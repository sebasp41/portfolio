"position of the parish priest in his native village was the highest in"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the scale of human attainment; but now that the big city had enlarged"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"of seventeen obstinately set out on his new project and stuck to it"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"until he won through. He became a civil servant. He was about"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"twenty-three years old, I think, when he succeeded in making himself"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"what he had resolved to become. Thus he was able to fulfil the promise"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"he had made as a poor boy not to return to his native village until he"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"was 'somebody.'"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"He had gained his end. But in the village there was nobody who had"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"remembered him as a little boy, and the village itself had become"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"strange to him."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"Now at last, when he was fifty-six years old, he gave up his active"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"career; but he could not bear to be idle for a single day. On the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"outskirts of the small market town of Lambach in Upper Austria he bought"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"a farm and tilled it himself. Thus, at the end of a long and"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"hard-working career, he came back to the life which his father had led."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"It was at this period that I first began to have ideals of my own. I"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"spent a good deal of time scampering about in the open, on the long road"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"from school, and mixing up with some of the roughest of the boys, which"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"caused my mother many anxious moments. All this tended to make me"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"something quite the reverse of a stay-at-home. I gave scarcely any"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"serious thought to the question of choosing a vocation in life; but I"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"was certainly quite out of sympathy with the kind of career which my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"father had followed. I think that an inborn talent for speaking now"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"began to develop and take shape during the more or less strenuous"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"arguments which I used to have with my comrades. I had become a juvenile"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"ringleader who learned well and easily at school but was rather"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"difficult to manage. In my freetime I practised singing in the choir of"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the monastery church at Lambach, and thus it happened that I was placed"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"in a very favourable position to be emotionally impressed again and"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"again by the magnificent splendour of ecclesiastical ceremonial. What"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"could be more natural for me than to look upon the Abbot as representing"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the highest human ideal worth striving for, just as the position of the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"humble village priest had appeared to my father in his own boyhood days?"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"At least, that was my idea for a while. But the juvenile disputes I had"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"with my father did not lead him to appreciate his son's oratorical gifts"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"in such a way as to see in them a favourable promise for such a career,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"and so he naturally could not understand the boyish ideas I had in my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"head at that time. This contradiction in my character made him feel"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"somewhat anxious."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"As a matter of fact, that transitory yearning after such a vocation soon"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"gave way to hopes that were better suited to my temperament. Browsing"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"through my father's books, I chanced to come across some publications"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"that dealt with military subjects. One of these publications was a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"popular history of the Franco-German War of 1870-71. It consisted of two"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"volumes of an illustrated periodical dating from those years. These"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"became my favourite reading. In a little while that great and heroic"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"conflict began to take first place in my mind. And from that time"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"onwards I became more and more enthusiastic about everything that was in"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"any way connected with war or military affairs."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"But this story of the Franco-German War had a special significance for"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"me on other grounds also. For the first time, and as yet only in quite a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"vague way, the question began to present itself: Is there a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"difference--and if there be, what is it--between the Germans who fought"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"that war and the other Germans? Why did not Austria also take part in"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"it? Why did not my father and all the others fight in that struggle? Are"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"we not the same as the other Germans? Do we not all belong together?"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"That was the first time that this problem began to agitate my small"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"brain. And from the replies that were given to the questions which I"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"asked very tentatively, I was forced to accept the fact, though with a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"secret envy, that not all Germans had the good luck to belong to"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"Bismarck's Empire. This was something that I could not understand."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"It was decided that I should study. Considering my character as a whole,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"and especially my temperament, my father decided that the classical"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"subjects studied at the Lyceum were not suited to my natural talents. He"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"thought that the REALSCHULE (Note 2) would suit me better. My obvious"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"talent for drawing confirmed him in that view; for in his opinion drawing"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"was a subject too much neglected in the Austrian GYMNASIUM. Probably also"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the memory of the hard road which he himself had travelled contributed to"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"make him look upon classical studies as unpractical and accordingly to"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"set little value on them. At the back of his mind he had the idea that"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"his son also should become an official of the Government. Indeed he had"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"decided on that career for me. The difficulties through which he had to"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"struggle in making his own career led him to overestimate what he had"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"achieved, because this was exclusively the result of his own"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"indefatigable industry and energy. The characteristic pride of the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"self-made man urged him towards the idea that his son should follow the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"same calling and if possible rise to a higher position in it. Moreover,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"this idea was strengthened by the consideration that the results of his"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"own life's industry had placed him in a position to facilitate his son's"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"advancement in the same career."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"He was simply incapable of imagining that I might reject what had meant"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"everything in life to him. My father's decision was simple, definite,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"clear and, in his eyes, it was something to be taken for granted. A man"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"of such a nature who had become an autocrat by reason of his own hard"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"struggle for existence, could not think of allowing 'inexperienced' and"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"irresponsible young fellows to choose their own careers. To act in such"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"a way, where the future of his own son was concerned, would have been a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"grave and reprehensible weakness in the exercise of parental authority"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"and responsibility, something utterly incompatible with his"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"And yet it had to be otherwise."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"For the first time in my life--I was then eleven years old--I felt"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"father might be about putting his own plans and opinions into action,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"his son was no less obstinate in refusing to accept ideas on which he"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"set little or no value."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"I would not become a civil servant."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"No amount of persuasion and no amount of 'grave' warnings could break"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"account. All the attempts which my father made to arouse in me a love or"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"liking for that profession, by picturing his own career for me, had only"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the opposite effect. It nauseated me to think that one day I might be"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"fettered to an office stool, that I could not dispose of my own time but"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"would be forced to spend the whole of my life filling out forms."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"One can imagine what kind of thoughts such a prospect awakened in the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"mind of a young fellow who was by no means what is called a 'good boy'"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"in the current sense of that term. The ridiculously easy school tasks"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"which we were given made it possible for me to spend far more time in"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the open air than at home. To-day, when my political opponents pry into"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"my life with diligent scrutiny, as far back as the days of my boyhood,"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"so as finally to be able to prove what disreputable tricks this Hitler"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"was accustomed to in his young days, I thank heaven that I can look back"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"to those happy days and find the memory of them helpful. The fields and"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"Even attendance at the REALSCHULE could not alter my way of spending my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"time. But I had now another battle to fight."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"So long as the paternal plan to make a State functionary contradicted my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"own inclinations only in the abstract, the conflict was easy to bear. I"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"could be discreet about expressing my personal views and thus avoid"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"constantly recurrent disputes. My own resolution not to become a"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"Government official was sufficient for the time being to put my mind"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"completely at rest. I held on to that resolution inexorably. But the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"situation became more difficult once I had a positive plan of my own"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"which I might present to my father as a counter-suggestion. This"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"happened when I was twelve years old. How it came about I cannot exactly"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"say now; but one day it became clear to me that I would be a painter--I"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"mean an artist. That I had an aptitude for drawing was an admitted fact."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"It was even one of the reasons why my father had sent me to the"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"REALSCHULE; but he had never thought of having that talent developed in"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"such a way that I could take up painting as a professional career. Quite"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the contrary. When, as a result of my renewed refusal to adopt his"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"favourite plan, my father asked me for the first time what I myself"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"really wished to be, the resolution that I had already formed expressed"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"itself almost automatically. For a while my father was speechless. A
painter? An artist-painter? he exclaimed."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"He wondered whether I was in a sound state of mind. He thought that he"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"might not have caught my words rightly, or that he had misunderstood"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"what I meant. But when I had explained my ideas to him and he saw how"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"seriously I took them, he opposed them with that full determination"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"which was characteristic of him. His decision was exceedingly simple and"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"could not be deflected from its course by any consideration of what my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"own natural qualifications really were."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"Artist! Not as long as I live, never. As the son had inherited some of"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"the father's obstinacy, besides having other qualities of his own, my"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"reply was equally energetic. But it stated something quite the contrary."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"At that our struggle became stalemate. The father would not abandon his"	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"
"'Never', and I became all the more consolidated in my 'Nevertheless'."	"CHAPTER I    IN THE HOME OF MY PARENTS"

"which also formed part of the Academy. At first it was impossible to"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"understand how this could be so, seeing that I had never been to a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"bitterly to rue my former conduct in neglecting and despising certain"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"apprehension to the morrow, and there was no such thing as a social"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"the small bourgeois class. Therefore it was a world that had very little"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"contact with the world of genuine manual labourers. For, though at first"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"this may appear astonishing, the ditch which separates that class, which"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"is by no means economically well-off; from the manual labouring class is"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"often deeper than people think. The reason for this division, which we"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"may almost call enmity, lies in the fear that dominates a social group"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which has only just risen above the level of the manual labourer--a fear"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"lest it may fall back into its old condition or at least be classed with"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the labourers. Moreover, there is something repulsive in remembering the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"cultural indigence of that lower class and their rough manners with one"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"another; so that people who are only on the first rung of the social"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"through his own efforts to a social level higher than that to which he"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"formerly belonged. In the case of such a person the hard struggle"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"through which he passes often destroys his normal human sympathy. His"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"loathsome destitution were intermingled in violent contrast. In the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"had a population of fifty-two millions, with all the perilous charm of a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"State made up of multiple nationalities. The dazzling splendour of the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Court acted like a magnet on the wealth and intelligence of the whole"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"policy of the Habsburg Monarchy in centralizing everything in itself and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"for itself."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"This centralizing policy was necessary in order to hold together that"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"of military officers of high rank, State officials, artists and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"scientists, there was the still vaster horde of workers. Abject poverty"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"distress, as do the majority of those who have been favoured by fortune"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"and those who have risen in the social scale through their own routine"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"in this connection there is no question at all of distributing favours"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"the temptation to study the social question in the way just mentioned,"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"for the simple reason that I was forced to live in the midst of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"poverty-stricken people. Therefore it was not a question of studying the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"of the chance to earn his bread. Here the element of uncertainty in"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"gradually settled down to my surroundings, and the confused picture"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"began to grow clearer, did I acquire a more discriminating view of my"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"I will not say that the manner in which I first became acquainted with"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"it was particularly unpleasant for me. In the Jew I still saw only a man"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"tolerance, I was against the idea that he should be attacked because he"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"had a different faith. And so I considered that the tone adopted by the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"anti-Semitic Press in Vienna was unworthy of the cultural traditions of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"a great people. The memory of certain events which happened in the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"middle ages came into my mind, and I felt that I should not like to see"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"belong to the first rank--but I did not then understand the reason of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"this--and so I regarded them more as the products of jealousy and envy"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"rather than the expression of a sincere, though wrong-headed, feeling."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"My own opinions were confirmed by what I considered to be the infinitely"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"I diligently read what was generally called the World Press--NEUE FREIE"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"information they gave their readers and the impartial way in which they"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"presented particular problems. I appreciated their dignified tone; but"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"sometimes the flamboyancy of the style was unconvincing, and I did not"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"like it. But I attributed all this to the overpowering influence of the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"world metropolis."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Since I considered Vienna at that time as such a world metropolis, I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"thought this constituted sufficient grounds to excuse these shortcomings"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"of the Press. But I was frequently disgusted by the grovelling way in"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which the Vienna Press played lackey to the Court. Scarcely a move took"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"place at the Hofburg which was not presented in glorified colours to the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"readers. It was a foolish practice, which, especially when it had to do"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"with 'The Wisest Monarch of all Times', reminded one almost of the dance"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which the mountain cock performs at pairing time to woo his mate. It was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"all empty nonsense. And I thought that such a policy was a stain on the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"ideal of liberal democracy. I thought that this way of currying favour"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"at the Court was unworthy of the people. And that was the first blot"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"that fell on my appreciation of the great Vienna Press."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"While in Vienna I continued to follow with a vivid interest all the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"events that were taking place in Germany, whether connected with"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"political or cultural question. I had a feeling of pride and admiration"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"when I compared the rise of the young German Empire with the decline of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the Austrian State. But, although the foreign policy of that Empire was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"looked upon him not only as the German Emperor but, above all, as the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"creator of the German Navy. The fact that the Emperor was prohibited"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"from speaking in the Reichstag made me very angry, because the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"royal equipage and went off into wild ecstacies of delight if the nag"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"wagged its tail in response. And at the same time these newspapers took"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"up an attitude of anxiety in matters that concerned the German Emperor,"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"trying to cloak their enmity by the serious air they gave themselves."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"But in my eyes that enmity appeared to be only poorly cloaked. Naturally"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"they protested that they had no intention of mixing in Germany's"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"internal affairs--God forbid! They pretended that by touching a delicate"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"upon them by reason of the mutual alliance between the two countries and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"at the same time discharging their obligations of journalistic"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"truthfulness. Having thus excused themselves about tenderly touching a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"That sort of thing made my blood boil. And now I began to be more and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"more on my guard when reading the great Vienna Press."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"I had to acknowledge, however, that on such subjects one of the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"What got still more on my nerves was the repugnant manner in which the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"big newspapers cultivated admiration for France. One really had to feel"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"ashamed of being a German when confronted by those mellifluous hymns of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"praise for 'the great culture-nation'. This wretched Gallomania more"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"often than once made me throw away one of those 'world newspapers'. I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"now often turned to the VOLKSBLATT, which was much smaller in size but"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which treated such subjects more decently. I was not in accord with its"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"sharp anti-Semitic tone; but again and again I found that its arguments"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"gave me grounds for serious thought."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Anyhow, it was as a result of such reading that I came to know the man"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"and the movement which then determined the fate of Vienna. These were"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Dr. Karl Lueger and the Christian Socialist Movement. At the time I came"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"to Vienna I felt opposed to both. I looked on the man and the movement"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"as 'reactionary'."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"But even an elementary sense of justice enforced me to change my opinion"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"when I had the opportunity of knowing the man and his work, and slowly"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"that opinion grew into outspoken admiration when I had better grounds"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"for forming a judgment. To-day, as well as then, I hold Dr. Karl Lueger"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"as the most eminent type of German Burgermeister. How many prejudices"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"Christian-Socialist Movement!"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"My ideas about anti-Semitism changed also in the course of time, but"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"that was the change which I found most difficult. It cost me a greater"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"internal conflict with myself, and it was only after a struggle between"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"reason and sentiment that victory began to be decided in favour of the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"former. Two years later sentiment rallied to the side of reasons and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"At the time of this bitter struggle, between calm reason and the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"sentiments in which I had been brought up, the lessons that I learned on"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the streets of Vienna rendered me invaluable assistance. A time came"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"when I no longer passed blindly along the street of the mighty city, as"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"I had done in the early days, but now with my eyes open not only to"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"study the buildings but also the human beings."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Once, when passing through the inner City, I suddenly encountered a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"phenomenon in a long caftan and wearing black side-locks. My first"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"thought was: Is this a Jew? They certainly did not have this appearance"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"in Linz. I watched the man stealthily and cautiously; but the longer I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"gazed at the strange countenance and examined it feature by feature, the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"more the question shaped itself in my brain: Is this a German?"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"As was always my habit with such experiences, I turned to books for help"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"in removing my doubts. For the first time in my life I bought myself"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"some anti-Semitic pamphlets for a few pence. But unfortunately they all"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"began with the assumption that in principle the reader had at least a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"certain degree of information on the Jewish question or was even"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"familiar with it. Moreover, the tone of most of these pamphlets was such"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"that I became doubtful again, because the statements made were partly"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"superficial and the proofs extraordinarily unscientific. For weeks, and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"indeed for months, I returned to my old way of thinking. The subject"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"appeared so enormous and the accusations were so far-reaching that I was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"afraid of dealing with it unjustly and so I became again anxious and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"uncertain."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Naturally I could no longer doubt that here there was not a question of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Germans who happened to be of a different religion but rather that there"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"was question of an entirely different people. For as soon as I began to"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"investigate the matter and observe the Jews, then Vienna appeared to me"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"in a different light. Wherever I now went I saw Jews, and the more I saw"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"of them the more strikingly and clearly they stood out as a different"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"people from the other citizens. Especially the Inner City and the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"district northwards from the Danube Canal swarmed with a people who,"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"even in outer appearance, bore no similarity to the Germans."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"But any indecision which I may still have felt about that point was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"finally removed by the activities of a certain section of the Jews"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"themselves. A great movement, called Zionism, arose among them. Its aim"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"was to assert the national character of Judaism, and the movement was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"strongly represented in Vienna."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"To outward appearances it seemed as if only one group of Jews championed"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"this movement, while the great majority disapproved of it, or even"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"repudiated it. But an investigation of the situation showed that those"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"outward appearances were purposely misleading. These outward appearances"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"emerged from a mist of theories which had been produced for reasons of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"expediency, if not for purposes of downright deception. For that part of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Jewry which was styled Liberal did not disown the Zionists as if they"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"were not members of their race but rather as brother Jews who publicly"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"professed their faith in an unpractical way, so as to create a danger"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"for Jewry itself."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Thus there was no real rift in their internal solidarity."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"This fictitious conflict between the Zionists and the Liberal Jews soon"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"disgusted me; for it was false through and through and in direct"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"contradiction to the moral dignity and immaculate character on which"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"that race had always prided itself."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Cleanliness, whether moral or of another kind, had its own peculiar"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"looking at them and, unfortunately, very often also when not looking at"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"them at all. The odour of those people in caftans often used to make me"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"feel ill. Beyond that there were the unkempt clothes and the ignoble"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"exterior."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"All these details were certainly not attractive; but the revolting"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"feature was that beneath their unclean exterior one suddenly perceived"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the moral mildew of the chosen race."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"What soon gave me cause for very serious consideration were the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"activities of the Jews in certain branches of life, into the mystery of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which I penetrated little by little. Was there any shady undertaking,"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which at least one"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Jew did not participate? On putting the probing knife carefully to that"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"putrescent body, a little Jew who was often blinded by the sudden light."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"In my eyes the charge against Judaism became a grave one the moment I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"discovered the Jewish activities in the Press, in art, in literature and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the theatre. All unctuous protests were now more or less futile. One"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"needed only to look at the posters announcing the hideous productions of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"the cinema and theatre, and study the names of the authors who were"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"highly lauded there in order to become permanently adamant on Jewish"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"questions. Here was a pestilence, a moral pestilence, with which the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"public was being infected. It was worse than the Black Plague of long"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"ago. And in what mighty doses this poison was manufactured and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"distributed. Naturally, the lower the moral and intellectual level of"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"such an author of artistic products the more inexhaustible his"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"like a sewage pump, would shoot his filth directly in the face of other"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"members of the human race. In this connection we must remember there is"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"no limit to the number of such people. One ought to realize that for"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"one, Goethe, Nature may bring into existence ten thousand such"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"despoilers who act as the worst kind of germ-carriers in poisoning human"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"play this shameful part."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"And is it for this reason that they can be called the chosen people?"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"I began then to investigate carefully the names of all the fabricators"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"of these unclean products in public cultural life. The result of that"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"inquiry was still more disfavourable to the attitude which I had"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"The fact that nine-tenths of all the smutty literature, artistic tripe"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"and theatrical banalities, had to be charged to the account of people"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"who formed scarcely one per cent. of the nation--that fact could not be"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"gainsaid. It was there, and had to be admitted. Then I began to examine"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"my favourite 'World Press', with that fact before my mind."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"The deeper my soundings went the lesser grew my respect for that Press"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"which I formerly admired. Its style became still more repellent and I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"was forced to reject its ideas as entirely shallow and superficial. To"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"claim that in the presentation of facts and views its attitude was"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"impartial seemed to me to contain more falsehood than truth. The writers"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"were--Jews."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Thousands of details that I had scarcely noticed before seemed to me now"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"formerly looked at in a different light."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"I saw the Liberal policy of that Press in another light. Its dignified"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"tone in replying to the attacks of its adversaries and its dead silence"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"in other cases now became clear to me as part of a cunning and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"despicable way of deceiving the readers. Its brilliant theatrical"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"criticisms always praised the Jewish authors and its adverse, criticism"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"was reserved exclusively for the Germans."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"The light pin-pricks against William II showed the persistency of its"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"policy, just as did its systematic commendation of French culture and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"civilization. The subject matter of the feuilletons was trivial and"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"often pornographic. The language of this Press as a whole had the accent"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"of a foreign people. The general tone was openly derogatory to the"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"Germans and this must have been definitely intentional."	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"What were the interests that urged the Vienna Press to adopt such a"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"Then something happened which helped me to come to an early decision. I"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"
"began to see through the meaning of a whole series of events that were"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"imagination in order to be able to forecast the consequences which must"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"themselves to-day, or were the founders themselves the victims of an"	"CHAPTER II   YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA"

"At last I came to Munich, in the spring of 1912."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The city itself was as familiar to me as if I had lived for years within"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"its walls."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"This was because my studies in architecture had been constantly turning"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"my attention to the metropolis of German art. One must know Munich if"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"one would know Germany, and it is impossible to acquire a knowledge of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"German art without seeing Munich."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"All things considered, this pre-war sojourn was by far the happiest and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"most contented time of my life. My earnings were very slender; but after"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"all I did not live for the sake of painting. I painted in order to get"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the bare necessities of existence while I continued my studies. I was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"firmly convinced that I should finally succeed in reaching the goal I"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"had marked out for myself. And this conviction alone was strong enough"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to enable me to bear the petty hardships of everyday life without"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"worrying very much about them."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Moreover, almost from the very first moment of my sojourn there I came"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to love that city more than any other place known to me. A German city!"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"I said to myself. How different to Vienna. It was with a feeling of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"disgust that my imagination reverted to that Babylon of races. Another"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"pleasant feature here was the way the people spoke German, which was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"much nearer my own way of speaking than the Viennese idiom. The Munich"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"idiom recalled the days of my youth, especially when I spoke with those"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"who had come to Munich from Lower Bavaria. There were a thousand or more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"things which I inwardly loved or which I came to love during the course"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of my stay. But what attracted me most was the marvellous wedlock of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"native folk-energy with the fine artistic spirit of the city, that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"unique harmony from the Hofbräuhaus to the Odeon, from the October"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Festival to the PINAKOTHEK, etc. The reason why my heart's strings are"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"entwined around this city as around no other spot in this world is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"probably because Munich is and will remain inseparably connected with"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the development of my own career; and the fact that from the beginning"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of my visit I felt inwardly happy and contented is to be attributed to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the charm of the marvellous Wittelsbach Capital, which has attracted"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"probably everybody who is blessed with a feeling for beauty instead of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"commercial instincts."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Apart from my professional work, I was most interested in the study of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"current political events, particularly those which were connected with"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"foreign relations. I approached these by way of the German policy of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"alliances which, ever since my Austrian days, I had considered to be an"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"utterly mistaken one. But in Vienna I had not yet seen quite clearly how"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"far the German Empire had gone in the process of' self-delusion. In"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Vienna I was inclined to assume, or probably I persuaded myself to do so"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in order to excuse the German mistake, that possibly the authorities in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Berlin knew how weak and unreliable their ally would prove to be when"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"brought face to face with realities, but that, for more or less"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"mysterious reasons, they refrained from allowing their opinions on this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"point to be known in public. Their idea was that they should support the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"policy of alliances which Bismarck had initiated and the sudden"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"discontinuance of which might be undesirable, if for no other reason"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"than that it might arouse those foreign countries which were lying in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"wait for their chance or might alarm the Philistines at home."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But my contact with the people soon taught me, to my horror, that my"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"assumptions were wrong. I was amazed to find everywhere, even in circles"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"otherwise well informed, that nobody had the slightest intimation of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"real character of the Habsburg Monarchy. Among the common people in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"particular there was a prevalent illusion that the Austrian ally was a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Power which would have to be seriously reckoned with and would rally its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"man-power in the hour of need. The mass of the people continued to look"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"upon the Dual Monarchy as a 'German State' and believed that it could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"relied upon. They assumed that its strength could be measured by the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"millions of its subjects, as was the case in Germany. First of all, they"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"did not realize that Austria had ceased to be a German State and,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"secondly, that the conditions prevailing within the Austrian Empire were"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"steadily pushing it headlong to the brink of disaster."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"At that time I knew the condition of affairs in the Austrian State"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"better than the professional diplomats. Blindfolded, as nearly always,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"these diplomats stumbled along on their way to disaster. The opinions"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"prevailing among the bulk of the people reflected only what had been"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"drummed into them from official quarters above. And these higher"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"authorities grovelled before the 'Ally', as the people of old bowed down"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"before the Golden Calf. They probably thought that by being polite and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"amiable they might balance the lack of honesty on the other side. Thus"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"they took every declaration at its full face value."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Even while in Vienna I used to be annoyed again and again by the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"discrepancy between the speeches of the official statesmen and the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"contents of the Viennese Press. And yet Vienna was still a German city,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"at least as far as appearances went. But one encountered an utterly"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"different state of things on leaving Vienna, or rather German-Austria,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and coming into the Slav provinces. It needed only a glance at the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Prague newspapers in order to see how the whole exalted hocus-pocus of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the Triple Alliance was judged from there. In Prague there was nothing"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"but gibes and sneers for that masterpiece of statesmanship. Even in the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"piping times of peace, when the two emperors kissed each other on the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"brow in token of friendship, those papers did not cloak their belief"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that the alliance would be liquidated the moment a first attempt was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"made to bring it down from the shimmering glory of a Nibelungen ideal to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the plane of practical affairs."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Great indignation was aroused a few years later, when the alliances were"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"put to the first practical test. Italy not only withdrew from the Triple"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Alliance, leaving the other two members to march by themselves. but she"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"even joined their enemies. That anybody should believe even for a moment"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in the possibility of such a miracle as that of Italy fighting on the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"same side as Austria would be simply incredible to anyone who did not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"suffer from the blindness of official diplomacy. And that was just how"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"people felt in Austria also."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In Austria only the Habsburgs and the German-Austrians supported the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"alliance. The Habsburgs did so from shrewd calculation of their own"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"interests and from necessity. The Germans did it out of good faith and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"political ignorance. They acted in good faith inasmuch as they believed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that by establishing the Triple Alliance they were doing a great service"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to the German Empire and were thus helping to strengthen it and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"consolidate its defence. They showed their political ignorance, however,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in holding such ideas, because, instead of helping the German Empire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"they really chained it to a moribund State which might bring its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"associate into the grave with itself; and, above all, by championing"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"this alliance they fell more and more a prey to the Habsburg policy of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"de-Germanization. For the alliance gave the Habsburgs good grounds for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"believing that the German Empire would not interfere in their domestic"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"affairs and thus they were in a position to carry into effect, with more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ease and less risk, their domestic policy of gradually eliminating the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"German element. Not only could the 'objectiveness' of the German"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Government be counted upon, and thus there need be no fear of protest"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"from that quarter, but one could always remind the German-Austrians of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the alliance and thus silence them in case they should ever object to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the reprehensible means that were being employed to establish a Slav"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hegemony in the Dual Monarchy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"What could the German-Austrians do, when the people of the German Empire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"itself had openly proclaimed their trust and confidence in the Habsburg"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"régime?"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Should they resist, and thus be branded openly before their kinsfolk in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the REICH as traitors to their own national interests? They, who for so"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"many decades had sacrificed so much for the sake of their German"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"tradition!"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Once the influence of the Germans in Austria had been wiped out, what"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"then would be the value of the alliance? If the Triple Alliance were to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"be advantageous to Germany, was it not a necessary condition that the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"predominance of the German element in Austria should be maintained? Or"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"did anyone really believe that Germany could continue to be the ally of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a Habsburg Empire under the hegemony of the Slavs?"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The official attitude of German diplomacy, as well as that of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"general public towards internal problems affecting the Austrian"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nationalities was not merely stupid, it was insane. On the alliance, as"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"on a solid foundation, they grounded the security and future existence"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of a nation of seventy millions, while at the same time they allowed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"their partner to continue his policy of undermining the sole foundation"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of that alliance methodically and resolutely, from year to year. A day"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"must come when nothing but a formal contract with Viennese diplomats"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"would be left. The alliance itself, as an effective support, would be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"lost to Germany."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"As far as concerned Italy, such had been the case from the outset."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"If people in Germany had studied history and the psychology of nations a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"little more carefully not one of them could have believed for a single"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hour that the Quirinal and the Viennese Hofburg could ever stand"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"shoulder to shoulder on a common battle front. Italy would have exploded"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"like a volcano if any Italian government had dared to send a single"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Italian soldier to fight for the Habsburg State. So fanatically hated"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"was this State that the Italians could stand in no other relation to it"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"on a battle front except as enemies. More than once in Vienna I have"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"witnessed explosions of the contempt and profound hatred which 'allied'"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the Italian to the Austrian State. The crimes which the House of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Habsburg committed against Italian freedom and independence during"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"several centuries were too grave to be forgiven, even with the best of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"goodwill. But this goodwill did not exist, either among the rank and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"file of the population or in the government. Therefore for Italy there"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"were only two ways of co-existing with Austria--alliance or war. By"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"choosing the first it was possible to prepare leisurely for the second."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Especially since relations between Russia and Austria tended more and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"more towards the arbitrament of war, the German policy of alliances was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"as senseless as it was dangerous. Here was a classical instance which"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"demonstrated the lack of any broad or logical lines of thought."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But what was the reason for forming the alliance at all? It could not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have been other than the wish to secure the future of the REICH better"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"than if it were to depend exclusively on its own resources. But the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"future of the REICH could not have meant anything else than the problem"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of securing the means of existence for the German people."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The only questions therefore were the following: What form shall the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"life of the nation assume in the near future--that is to say within such"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a period as we can forecast? And by what means can the necessary"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"foundation and security be guaranteed for this development within the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"framework of the general distribution of power among the European"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nations? A clear analysis of the principles on which the foreign policy"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of German statecraft were to be based should have led to the following"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"conclusions:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The annual increase of population in Germany amounts to almost 900,000"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"souls. The difficulties of providing for this army of new citizens must"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"grow from year to year and must finally lead to a catastrophe, unless"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ways and means are found which will forestall the danger of misery and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hunger. There were four ways of providing against this terrible"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"calamity:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"(1) It was possible to adopt the French example and artificially"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"restrict the number of births, thus avoiding an excess of population."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Under certain circumstances, in periods of distress or under bad"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"climatic condition, or if the soil yields too poor a return, Nature"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"herself tends to check the increase of population in some countries and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"among some races, but by a method which is quite as ruthless as it is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"wise. It does not impede the procreative faculty as such; but it does"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"impede the further existence of the offspring by submitting it to such"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"tests and privations that everything which is less strong or less"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"healthy is forced to retreat into the bosom of tile unknown. Whatever"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"survives these hardships of existence has been tested and tried a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"thousandfold, hardened and renders fit to continue the process of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"procreation; so that the same thorough selection will begin all over"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"again. By thus dealing brutally with the individual and recalling him"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the very moment he shows that he is not fitted for the trials of life,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Nature preserves the strength of the race and the species and raises it"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to the highest degree of efficiency."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The decrease in numbers therefore implies an increase of strength, as"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"far as the individual is concerned, and this finally means the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"invigoration of the species."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But the case is different when man himself starts the process of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"numerical restriction. Man is not carved from Nature's wood. He is made"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of 'human' material. He knows more than the ruthless Queen of Wisdom. He"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"does not impede the preservation of the individual but prevents"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"procreation itself. To the individual, who always sees only himself and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not the race, this line of action seems more humane and just than the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"opposite way. But, unfortunately, the consequences are also the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"opposite."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"By leaving the process of procreation unchecked and by submitting the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"individual to the hardest preparatory tests in life, Nature selects the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"best from an abundance of single elements and stamps them as fit to live"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and carry on the conservation of the species. But man restricts the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"procreative faculty and strives obstinately to keep alive at any cost"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"whatever has once been born. This correction of the Divine Will seems to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"him to be wise and humane, and he rejoices at having trumped Nature's"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"card in one game at least and thus proved that she is not entirely"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"reliable. The dear little ape of an all-mighty father is delighted to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"see and hear that he has succeeded in effecting a numerical restriction;"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"but he would be very displeased if told that this, his system, brings"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"about a degeneration in personal quality."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"For as soon as the procreative faculty is thwarted and the number of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"births diminished, the natural struggle for existence which allows only"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"healthy and strong individuals to survive is replaced by a sheer craze"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to 'save' feeble and even diseased creatures at any cost. And thus the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"seeds are sown for a human progeny which will become more and more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"miserable from one generation to another, as long as Nature's will is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"scorned."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But if that policy be carried out the final results must be that such a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nation will eventually terminate its own existence on this earth; for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"though man may defy the eternal laws of procreation during a certain"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"period, vengeance will follow sooner or later. A stronger race will oust"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that which has grown weak; for the vital urge, in its ultimate form,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"will burst asunder all the absurd chains of this so-called humane"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"consideration for the individual and will replace it with the humanity"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of Nature, which wipes out what is weak in order to give place to the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"strong."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Any policy which aims at securing the existence of a nation by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"restricting the birth-rate robs that nation of its future."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"(2) A second solution is that of internal colonization. This is a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"proposal which is frequently made in our own time and one hears it"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"lauded a good deal. It is a suggestion that is well-meant but it is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"misunderstood by most people, so that it is the source of more mischief"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"than can be imagined."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It is certainly true that the productivity of the soil can be increased"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"within certain limits; but only within defined limits and not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"indefinitely. By increasing the productive powers of the soil it will be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"possible to balance the effect of a surplus birth-rate in Germany for a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"certain period of time, without running any danger of hunger. But we"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have to face the fact that the general standard of living is rising more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"quickly than even the birth rate. The requirements of food and clothing"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"are becoming greater from year to year and are out of proportion to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"those of our ancestors of, let us say, a hundred years ago. It would,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"therefore, be a mistaken view that every increase in the productive"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"powers of the soil will supply the requisite conditions for an increase"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in the population. No. That is true up to a certain point only, for at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"least a portion of the increased produce of the soil will be consumed by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the margin of increased demands caused by the steady rise in the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"standard of living. But even if these demands were to be curtailed to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the narrowest limits possible and if at the same time we were to use all"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"our available energies in the intenser cultivation, we should here reach"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a definite limit which is conditioned by the inherent nature of the soil"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"itself. No matter how industriously we may labour we cannot increase"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"agricultural production beyond this limit. Therefore, though we may"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"postpone the evil hour of distress for a certain time, it will arrive at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"last. The first phenomenon will be the recurrence of famine periods from"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"time to time, after bad harvests, etc. The intervals between these"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"famines will become shorter and shorter the more the population"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"increases; and, finally, the famine times will disappear only in those"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"rare years of plenty when the granaries are full. And a time will"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ultimately come when even in those years of plenty there will not be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"enough to go round; so that hunger will dog the footsteps of the nation."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Nature must now step in once more and select those who are to survive,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"or else man will help himself by artificially preventing his own"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"increase, with all the fatal consequences for the race and the species"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"which have been already mentioned."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It may be objected here that, in one form or another, this future is in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"store for all mankind and that the individual nation or race cannot"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"escape the general fate."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"At first glance, that objection seems logical enough; but we have to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"take the following into account:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The day will certainly come when the whole of mankind will be forced to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"check the augmentation of the human species, because there will be no"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"further possibility of adjusting the productivity of the soil to the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"perpetual increase in the population. Nature must then be allowed to use"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"her own methods or man may possibly take the task of regulation into his"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"own hands and establish the necessary equilibrium by the application of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"better means than we have at our disposal to-day. But then it will be a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"problem for mankind as a whole, whereas now only those races have to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"suffer from want which no longer have the strength and daring to acquire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"sufficient soil to fulfil their needs. For, as things stand to-day, vast"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"spaces still lie uncultivated all over the surface of the globe. Those"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"spaces are only waiting for the ploughshare. And it is quite certain"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that Nature did not set those territories apart as the exclusive"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"pastures of any one nation or race to be held unutilized in reserve for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the future. Such land awaits the people who have the strength to acquire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"it and the diligence to cultivate it."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Nature knows no political frontiers. She begins by establishing life on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"this globe and then watches the free play of forces. Those who show the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"greatest courage and industry are the children nearest to her heart and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"they will be granted the sovereign right of existence."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"If a nation confines itself to 'internal colonization' while other races"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"are perpetually increasing their territorial annexations all over the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"globe, that nation will be forced to restrict the numerical growth of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"its population at a time when the other nations are increasing theirs."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"This situation must eventually arrive. It will arrive soon if the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territory which the nation has at its disposal be small. Now it is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"unfortunately true that only too often the best nations--or, to speak"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"more exactly, the only really cultured nations, who at the same time are"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the chief bearers of human progress--have decided, in their blind"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"pacifism, to refrain from the acquisition of new territory and to be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"content with 'internal colonization.' But at the same time nations of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"inferior quality succeed in getting hold of large spaces for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonization all over the globe. The state of affairs which must result"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"from this contrast is the following:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Races which are culturally superior but less ruthless would be forced to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"restrict their increase, because of insufficient territory to support"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the population, while less civilized races could increase indefinitely,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"owing to the vast territories at their disposal. In other words: should"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that state of affairs continue, then the world will one day be possessed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"by that portion of mankind which is culturally inferior but more active"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and energetic."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"A time will come, even though in the distant future, when there can be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"only two alternatives: Either the world will be ruled according to our"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"modern concept of democracy, and then every decision will be in favour"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of the numerically stronger races; or the world will be governed by the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"law of natural distribution of power, and then those nations will be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"victorious who are of more brutal will and are not the nations who have"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"practised self-denial."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Nobody can doubt that this world will one day be the scene of dreadful"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"struggles for existence on the part of mankind. In the end the instinct"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of self-preservation alone will triumph. Before its consuming fire this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"so-called humanitarianism, which connotes only a mixture of fatuous"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"timidity and self-conceit, will melt away as under the March sunshine."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Man has become great through perpetual struggle. In perpetual peace his"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"greatness must decline."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"For us Germans, the slogan of 'internal colonization' is fatal, because"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"it encourages the belief that we have discovered a means which is in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"accordance with our innate pacifism and which will enable us to work for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"our livelihood in a half slumbering existence. Such a teaching, once it"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"were taken seriously by our people, would mean the end of all effort to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"acquire for ourselves that place in the world which we deserve. If. the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"average German were once convinced that by this measure he has the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"chance of ensuring his livelihood and guaranteeing his future, any"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"attempt to take an active and profitable part in sustaining the vital"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"demands of his country would be out of the question. Should the nation"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"agree to such an attitude then any really useful foreign policy might be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"looked upon as dead and buried, together with all hope for the future of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the German people."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Once we know what the consequences of this 'internal colonization'"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"theory would be we can no longer consider as a mere accident the fact"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that among those who inculcate this quite pernicious mentality among our"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"people the Jew is always in the first line. He knows his softies only"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"too well not to know that they are ready to be the grateful victims of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"every swindle which promises them a gold-block in the shape of a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"discovery that will enable them to outwit Nature and thus render"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"superfluous the hard and inexorable struggle for existence; so that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"finally they may become lords of the planet partly by sheer DOLCE FAR"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"NIENTE and partly by working when a pleasing opportunity arises."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It cannot be too strongly emphasised that any German 'internal"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonization' must first of all be considered as suited only for the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"relief of social grievances. To carry out a system of internal"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonization, the most important preliminary measure would be to free"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the soil from the grip of the speculator and assure that freedom. But"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"such a system could never suffice to assure the future of the nation"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"without the acquisition of new territory."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"If we adopt a different plan we shall soon reach a point beyond which"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the resources of our soil can no longer be exploited, and at the same"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"time we shall reach a point beyond which our man-power cannot develop."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In conclusion, the following must be said:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The fact that only up to a limited extent can internal colonization be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"practised in a national territory which is of definitely small area and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the restriction of the procreative faculty which follows as a result of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"such conditions--these two factors have a very unfavourable effect on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the military and political standing of a nation."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The extent of the national territory is a determining factor in the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"external security of the nation. The larger the territory which a people"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"has at its disposal the stronger are the national defences of that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"people. Military decisions are more quickly, more easily, more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"completely and more effectively gained against a people occupying a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"national territory which is restricted in area, than against States"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"which have extensive territories. Moreover, the magnitude of a national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territory is in itself a certain assurance that an outside Power will"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not hastily risk the adventure of an invasion; for in that case the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"struggle would have to be long and exhausting before victory could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hoped for. The risk being so great. there would have to be extraordinary"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"reasons for such an aggressive adventure. Hence it is that the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territorial magnitude of a State furnishes a basis whereon national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"liberty and independence can be maintained with relative ease; while, on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the contrary, a State whose territory is small offers a natural"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"temptation to the invader."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"As a matter of fact, so-called national circles in the German REICH"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"rejected those first two possibilities of establishing a balance between"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the constant numerical increase in the population and a national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territory which could not expand proportionately. But the reasons given"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"for that rejection were different from those which I have just"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"expounded. It was mainly on the basis of certain moral sentiments that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"restriction of the birth-rate was objected to. Proposals for internal"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonization were rejected indignantly because it was suspected that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"such a policy might mean an attack on the big landowners, and that this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"attack might be the forerunner of a general assault against the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"principle of private property as a whole. The form in which the latter"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"solution--internal colonization--was recommended justified the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"misgivings of the big landowners."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But the form in which the colonization proposal was rejected was not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"very clever, as regards the impression which such rejection might be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"calculated to make on the mass of the people, and anyhow it did not go"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to the root of the problem at all."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Only two further ways were left open in which work and bread could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"secured for the increasing population."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"(3) It was possible to think of acquiring new territory on which a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"certain portion of' the increasing population could be settled each"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"year; or else"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"(4) Our industry and commerce had to be organized in such a manner as to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"secure an increase in the exports and thus be able to support our people"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"by the increased purchasing power accruing from the profits made on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"foreign markets."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Therefore the problem was: A policy of territorial expansion or a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonial and commercial policy. Both policies were taken into"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"consideration, examined, recommended and rejected, from various"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"standpoints, with the result that the second alternative was finally"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"adopted. The sounder alternative, however, was undoubtedly the first."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The principle of acquiring new territory, on which the surplus"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"population could be settled, has many advantages to recommend it,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"especially if we take the future as well as the present into account."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In the first place, too much importance cannot be placed on the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"necessity for adopting a policy which will make it possible to maintain"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a healthy peasant class as the basis of the national community. Many of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"our present evils have their origin exclusively in the disproportion"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"between the urban and rural portions of the population. A solid stock of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"small and medium farmers has at all times been the best protection which"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a nation could have against the social diseases that are prevalent"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to-day. Moreover, that is the only solution which guarantees the daily"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"bread of a nation within the framework of its domestic national economy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"With this condition once guaranteed, industry and commerce would retire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"from the unhealthy position of foremost importance which they hold"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to-day and would take their due place within the general scheme of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"national economy, adjusting the balance between demand and supply. Thus"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"industry and commerce would no longer constitute the basis of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"national subsistence, but would be auxiliary institutions. By fulfilling"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"their proper function, which is to adjust the balance between national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"production and national consumption, they render the national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"subsistence more or less independent of foreign countries and thus"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"assure the freedom and independence of the nation, especially at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"critical junctures in its history."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Such a territorial policy, however, cannot find its fulfilment in the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Cameroons but almost exclusively here in Europe. One must calmly and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"squarely face the truth that it certainly cannot be part of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"dispensation of Divine Providence to give a fifty times larger share of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the soil of this world to one nation than to another. In considering"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"this state of affairs to-day, one must not allow existing political"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"frontiers to distract attention from what ought to exist on principles"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of strict justice. If this earth has sufficient room for all, then we"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ought to have that share of the soil which is absolutely necessary for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"our existence."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Of course people will not voluntarily make that accommodation. At this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"point the right of self-preservation comes into effect. And when"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"attempts to settle the difficulty in an amicable way are rejected the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"clenched hand must take by force that which was refused to the open hand"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of friendship. If in the past our ancestors had based their political"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"decisions on similar pacifist nonsense as our present generation does,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"we should not possess more than one-third of the national territory that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"we possess to-day and probably there would be no German nation to worry"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"about its future in Europe. No. We owe the two Eastern Marks (Note 8) of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the Empire to the natural determination of our forefathers in their"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"struggle for existence, and thus it is to the same determined policy that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"we owe the inner strength which is based on the extent of our political"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and racial territories and which alone has made it possible for us to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"exist up to now."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"[Note 8. German Austria was the East Mark on the South and East Prussia"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"was the East Mark on the North.]"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"And there is still another reason why that solution would have been the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"correct one:"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Many contemporary European States are like pyramids standing on their"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"apexes. The European territory which these States possess is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ridiculously small when compared with the enormous overhead weight of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"their colonies, foreign trade, etc. It may be said that they have the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"apex in Europe and the base of the pyramid all over the world; quite"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"different from the United States of America, which has its base on the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"strength of the U.S.A. and the contrary situation is responsible for the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"weakness of most of the colonial European Powers."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"England cannot be suggested as an argument against this assertion,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"Europe, since it forms a vast community of language and culture together"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"with the U.S.A."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Therefore the only possibility which Germany had of carrying a sound"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territorial policy into effect was that of acquiring new territory in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Europe itself. Colonies cannot serve this purpose as long as they are"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not suited for settlement by Europeans on a large scale. In the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nineteenth century it was no longer possible to acquire such colonies by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"peaceful means. Therefore any attempt at such a colonial expansion would"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have meant an enormous military struggle. Consequently it would have"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"been more practical to undertake that military struggle for new"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territory in Europe rather than to wage war for the acquisition of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"possessions abroad."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Such a decision naturally demanded that the nation's undivided energies"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"should be devoted to it. A policy of that kind which requires for its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"fulfilment every ounce of available energy on the part of everybody"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"concerned, cannot be carried into effect by half-measures or in a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hesitating manner. The political leadership of the German Empire should"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"then have been directed exclusively to this goal. No political step"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"should have been taken in response to other considerations than this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"task and the means of accomplishing it. Germany should have been alive"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to the fact that such a goal could have been reached only by war, and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the prospect of war should have been faced with calm and collected"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"determination."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The whole system of alliances should have been envisaged and valued from"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that standpoint. If new territory were to be acquired in Europe it must"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have been mainly at Russia's cost, and once again the new German Empire"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"should have set out on its march along the same road as was formerly"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"trodden by the Teutonic Knights, this time to acquire soil for the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"German plough by means of the German sword and thus provide the nation"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"with its daily bread."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"For such a policy, however, there was only one possible ally in Europe."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"That was England."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Only by alliance with England was it possible to safeguard the rear of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the new German crusade. The justification for undertaking such an"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"expedition was stronger than the justification which our forefathers had"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"for setting out on theirs. Not one of our pacifists refuses to eat the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"here was that called the 'Sword'."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"No sacrifice should have been considered too great if it was a necessary"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"Only a clear and definite policy could lead to such an achievement. Such"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"a policy would have demanded a renunciation of the endeavour to conquer"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the world's markets, also a renunciation of colonial intentions and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"naval power. All the means of power at the disposal of the State should"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have been concentrated in the military forces on land. This policy would"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"have involved a period of temporary self-denial, for the sake of a great"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and powerful future."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"There was a time when England might have entered into negotiations with"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"us, on the grounds of that proposal. For England would have well"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"understood that the problems arising from the steady increase in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"population were forcing Germany to look for a solution either in Europe"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"with the help of England or, without England, in some other part of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"world."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"This outlook was probably the chief reason why London tried to draw"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nearer to Germany about the turn of the century. For the first time in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Germany an attitude was then manifested which afterwards displayed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"itself in a most tragic way. People then gave expression to an"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"unpleasant feeling that we might thus find ourselves obliged to pull"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"England's chestnuts out of the fire. As if an alliance could be based on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"anything else than mutual give-and-take! And England would have become a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"party to such a mutual bargain. British diplomats were still wise enough"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to know that an equivalent must be forthcoming as a consideration for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"any services rendered."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Let us suppose that in 1904 our German foreign policy was managed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"astutely enough to enable us to take the part which Japan played. It is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not easy to measure the greatness of the results that might have accrued"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to Germany from such a policy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"There would have been no world war. The blood which would have been shed"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in 1904 would not have been a tenth of that shed from 1914 to 1918. And"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"what a position Germany would hold in the world to-day?"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In any case the alliance with Austria was then an absurdity."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"For this mummy of a State did not attach itself to Germany for the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"purpose of carrying through a war, but rather to maintain a perpetual"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"state of peace which was meant to be exploited for the purpose of slowly"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"but persistently exterminating the German element in the Dual Monarchy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Another reason for the impossible character of this alliance was that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nobody could expect such a State to take an active part in defending"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"German national interests, seeing that it did not have sufficient"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"strength and determination to put an end to the policy of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"de-Germanization within its own frontiers. If Germany herself was not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"moved by a sufficiently powerful national sentiment and was not"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"sufficiently ruthless to take away from that absurd Habsburg State the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"right to decide the destinies of ten million inhabitants who were of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"same nationality as the Germans themselves, surely it was out of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"question to expect the Habsburg State to be a collaborating party in any"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"great and courageous German undertaking. The attitude of the old REICH"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"towards the Austrian question might have been taken as a test of its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"stamina for the struggle where the destinies of the whole nation were at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"stake."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In any case, the policy of oppression against the German population in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Austria should not have been allowed to be carried on and to grow"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"stronger from year to year; for the value of Austria as an ally could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"assured only by upholding the German element there. But that course was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not followed."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Nothing was dreaded so much as the possibility of an armed conflict; but"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"finally, and at a most unfavourable moment, the conflict had to be faced"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and accepted. They thought to cut loose from the cords of destiny, but"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"destiny held them fast."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"They dreamt of maintaining a world peace and woke up to find themselves"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"in a world war."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"And that dream of peace was a most significant reason why the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"above-mentioned third alternative for the future development of Germany"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"was not even taken into consideration. The fact was recognized that new"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"territory could be gained only in the East; but this meant that there"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"would be fighting ahead, whereas they wanted peace at any cost. The"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"slogan of German foreign policy at one time used to be: The use of all"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"possible means for the maintenance of the German nation. Now it was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"changed to: Maintenance of world peace by all possible means. We know"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"what the result was. I shall resume the discussion of this point in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"detail later on."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"There remained still another alternative, which we may call the fourth."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"This was: Industry and world trade, naval power and colonies."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Such a development might certainly have been attained more easily and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"more rapidly. To colonize a territory is a slow process, often extending"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"over centuries. Yet this fact is the source of its inner strength, for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"it is not through a sudden burst of enthusiasm that it can be put into"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"effect, but rather through a gradual and enduring process of growth"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"quite different from industrial progress, which can be urged on by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"advertisement within a few years. The result thus achieved, however, is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"not of lasting quality but something frail, like a soap-bubble. It is"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"much easier to build quickly than to carry through the tough task of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"settling a territory with farmers and establishing farmsteads. But the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"former is more quickly destroyed than the latter."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In adopting such a course Germany must have known that to follow it out"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"would necessarily mean war sooner or later. Only children could believe"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that sweet and unctuous expressions of goodness and persistent avowals"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of peaceful intentions could get them their bananas through this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"'friendly competition between the nations', with the prospect of never"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"having to fight for them."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"No. Once we had taken this road, England was bound to be our enemy at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"some time or other to come. Of course it fitted in nicely with our"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"innocent assumptions, but still it was absurd to grow indignant at the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"fact that a day came when the English took the liberty of opposing our"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"peaceful penetration with the brutality of violent egoists."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Naturally, we on our side would never have done such a thing."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"If a European territorial policy against Russia could have been put into"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"practice only in case we had England as our ally, on the other hand a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"colonial and world-trade policy could have been carried into effect only"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"against English interests and with the support of Russia. But then this"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"policy should have been adopted in full consciousness of all the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"consequences it involved and, above all things, Austria should have been"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"discarded as quickly as possible."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"At the turn of the century the alliance with Austria had become a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"veritable absurdity from all points of view."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But nobody thought of forming an alliance with Russia against England,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"just as nobody thought of making England an ally against Russia; for in"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"either case the final result would inevitably have meant war. And to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"avoid war was the very reason why a commercial and industrial policy was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"decided upon. It was believed that the peaceful conquest of the world by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"commercial means provided a method which would permanently supplant the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"policy of force. Occasionally, however, there were doubts about the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"efficiency of this principle, especially when some quite"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"incomprehensible warnings came from England now and again. That was the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"reason why the fleet was built. It was not for the purpose of attacking"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"or annihilating England but merely to defend the concept of world-peace,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"mentioned above, and also to protect the principle of conquering the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"world by 'peaceful' means. Therefore this fleet was kept within modest"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"limits, not only as regards the number and tonnage of the vessels but"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"also in regard to their armament, the idea being to furnish new proofs"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"of peaceful intentions."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"The chatter about the peaceful conquest of the world by commercial means"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"was probably the most completely nonsensical stuff ever raised to the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"dignity of a guiding principle in the policy of a State, This nonsense"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"became even more foolish when England was pointed out as a typical"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"example to prove how the thing could be put into practice. Our doctrinal"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"way of regarding history and our professorial ideas in that domain have"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"done irreparable harm and offer a striking 'proof' of how people 'learn'"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"history without understanding anything of it. As a matter of fact,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"England ought to have been looked upon as a convincing argument against"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the theory of the pacific conquest of the world by commercial means. No"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nation prepared the way for its commercial conquests more brutally than"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"England did by means of the sword, and no other nation has defended such"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"conquests more ruthlessly. Is it not a characteristic quality of British"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"statecraft that it knows how to use political power in order to gain"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"economic advantages and, inversely, to turn economic conquests into"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"political power? What an astounding error it was to believe that England"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"would not have the courage to give its own blood for the purposes of its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"own economic expansion! The fact that England did not possess a national"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"army proved nothing; for it is not the actual military structure of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"moment that matters but rather the will and determination to use"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"whatever military strength is available. England has always had the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"armament which she needed. She always fought with those weapons which"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"were necessary for success. She sent mercenary troops, to fight as long"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"as mercenaries sufficed; but she never hesitated to draw heavily and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"deeply from the best blood of the whole nation when victory could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"obtained only by such a sacrifice. And in every case the fighting"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"spirit, dogged determination, and use of brutal means in conducting"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"military operations have always remained the same."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"But in Germany, through the medium of the schools, the Press and the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"comic papers, an idea of the Englishman was gradually formed which was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"bound eventually to lead to the worst kind of self-deception. This"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"absurdity slowly but persistently spread into every quarter of German"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"life. The result was an undervaluation for which we have had to pay a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"heavy penalty. The delusion was so profound that the Englishman was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"looked upon as a shrewd business man, but personally a coward even to an"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"incredible degree. Unfortunately our lofty teachers of professorial"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"history did not bring home to the minds of their pupils the truth that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"it is not possible to build up such a mighty organization as the British"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Empire by mere swindle and fraud. The few who called attention to that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"truth were either ignored or silenced. I can vividly recall to mind the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"astonished looks of my comrades when they found themselves personally"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"face to face for the first time with the Tommies in Flanders. After a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"few days of fighting the consciousness slowly dawned on our soldiers"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that those Scotsmen were not like the ones we had seen described and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"caricatured in the comic papers and mentioned in the communiqués."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It was then that I formed my first ideas of the efficiency of various"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"forms of propaganda."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Such a falsification, however, served the purpose of those who had"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"fabricated it. This caricature of the Englishman, though false, could be"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"used to prove the possibility of conquering the world peacefully by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"commercial means. Where the Englishman succeeded we should also succeed."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Our far greater honesty and our freedom from that specifically English"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"'perfidy' would be assets on our side. Thereby it was hoped that the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"sympathy of the smaller nations and the confidence of the greater"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"nations could be gained more easily."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"We did not realize that our honesty was an object of profound aversion"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"for other people because we ourselves believed in it. The rest of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"world looked on our behaviour as the manifestation of a shrewd"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"deceitfulness; but when the revolution came, then they were amazed at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the deeper insight it gave them into our mentality, sincere even beyond"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the limits of stupidity."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Once we understand the part played by that absurd notion of conquering"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the world by peaceful commercial means we can clearly understand how"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"that other absurdity, the Triple Alliance, came to exist. With what"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"State then could an alliance have been made? In alliance with Austria we"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"could not acquire new territory by military means, even in Europe. And"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"this very fact was the real reason for the inner weakness of the Triple"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Alliance. A Bismarck could permit himself such a makeshift for the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"necessities of the moment, but certainly not any of his bungling"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"successors, and least of all when the foundations no longer existed on"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"which Bismarck had formed the Triple Alliance. In Bismarck's time"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Austria could still be looked upon as a German State; but the gradual"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"introduction of universal suffrage turned the country into a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"parliamentary Babel, in which the German voice was scarcely audible."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"From the viewpoint of racial policy, this alliance with Austria was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"simply disastrous. A new Slavic Great Power was allowed to grow up close"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to the frontiers of the German Empire. Later on this Power was bound to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"adopt towards Germany an attitude different from that of Russia, for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"example. The Alliance was thus bound to become more empty and more"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"feeble, because the only supporters of it were losing their influence"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and were being systematically pushed out of the more important public"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"offices."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"About the year 1900 the Alliance with Austria had already entered the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"same phase as the Alliance between Austria and Italy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Here also only one alternative was possible: Either to take the side of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the Habsburg Monarchy or to raise a protest against the oppression of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the German element in Austria. But, generally speaking, when one takes"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"such a course it is bound eventually to lead to open conflict."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"From the psychological point of view also, the Triple decreases"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"according as such an alliance limits its object to the defence of the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"STATUS QUO. But, on the other hand, an alliance will increase its"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"cohesive strength the more the parties concerned in it may hope to use"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"it as a means of reaching some practical goal of expansion. Here, as"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"everywhere else, strength does not lie in defence but in attack."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"This truth was recognized in various quarters but, unfortunately, not by"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the so-called elected representatives of the people. As early as 1912"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Ludendorff, who was then Colonel and an Officer of the General Staff,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"pointed out these weak features of the Alliance in a memorandum which he"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"then drew up. But of course the 'statesmen' did not attach any"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"importance or value to that document. In general it would seem as if"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"reason were a faculty that is active only in the case of ordinary"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"mortals but that it is entirely absent when we come to deal with that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"branch of the species known as 'diplomats'."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It was lucky for Germany that the war of 1914 broke out with Austria as"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"its direct cause, for thus the Habsburgs were compelled to participate."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Had the origin of the War been otherwise, Germany would have been left"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to her own resources. The Habsburg State would never have been ready or"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"willing to take part in a war for the origin of which Germany was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"responsible. What was the object of so much obloquy later in the case of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Italy's decision would have taken place, only earlier, in the case of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Austria. In other words, if Germany had been forced to go to war for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"some reason of its own, Austria would have remained 'neutral' in order"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"to safeguard the State against a revolution which might begin"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"immediately after the war had started. The Slav element would have"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"preferred to smash up the Dual Monarchy in 1914 rather than permit it to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"come to the assistance of Germany. But at that time there were only a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"few who understood all the dangers and aggravations which resulted from"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"the alliance with the Danubian Monarchy."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In the first place, Austria had too many enemies who were eagerly"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"looking forward to obtain the heritage of that decrepit State, so that"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"these people gradually developed a certain animosity against Germany,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"because Germany was an obstacle to their desires inasmuch as it kept the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Dual Monarchy from falling to pieces, a consummation that was hoped for"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and yearned for on all sides. The conviction developed that Vienna could"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"be reached only by passing through Berlin."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In the second place, by adopting this policy Germany lost its best and"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"most promising chances of other alliances. In place of these"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"possibilities one now observed a growing tension in the relations with"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Russia and even with Italy. And this in spite of the fact that the"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"general attitude in Rome was just as favourable to Germany as it was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"hostile to Austria, a hostility which lay dormant in the individual"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Italian and broke out violently on occasion."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Since a commercial and industrial policy had been adopted, no motive was"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"left for waging war against Russia. Only the enemies of the two"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"countries, Germany and Russia, could have an active interest in such a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"war under these circumstances. As a matter of fact, it was only the Jews"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"and the Marxists who tried to stir up bad blood between the two States."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"In the third place, the Alliance constituted a permanent danger to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"German security; for any great Power that was hostile to Bismarck's"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Empire could mobilize a whole lot of other States in a war against"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"Germany by promising them tempting spoils at the expense of the Austrian"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"ally."	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"It was possible to arouse the whole of Eastern Europe against Austria,"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"especially Russia, and Italy also. The world coalition which had"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"developed under the leadership of King Edward could never have become a"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"reality if Germany's ally, Austria, had not offered such an alluring"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"prospect of booty. It was this fact alone which made it possible to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"combine so many heterogeneous States with divergent interests into one"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"common phalanx of attack. Every member could hope to enrich himself at"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"The qualities which are employed for the foundation and preservation of"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"inner strength of a State only very rarely coincides with what is called"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"
"its economic expansion. On the contrary, there are numerous examples to"	"CHAPTER IV   MUNICH"

"Thus I used to think it an ill-deserved stroke of bad luck that I had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"arrived too late on this terrestrial globe, and I felt chagrined at the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"idea that my life would have to run its course along peaceful and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"orderly lines. As a boy I was anything but a pacifist and all attempts"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to make me so turned out futile."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Then the Boer War came, like a glow of lightning on the far horizon. Day"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"after day I used to gaze intently at the newspapers and I almost"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"'devoured' the telegrams and COMMUNIQUES, overjoyed to think that I"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"could witness that heroic struggle, even though from so great a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"distance."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"When the Russo-Japanese War came I was older and better able to judge"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"for myself. For national reasons I then took the side of the Japanese in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"our discussions. I looked upon the defeat of the Russians as a blow to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Austrian Slavism."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Many years had passed between that time and my arrival in Munich. I now"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"realized that what I formerly believed to be a morbid decadence was only"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the lull before the storm. During my Vienna days the Balkans were"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"already in the grip of that sultry pause which presages the violent"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"storm. Here and there a flash of lightning could be occasionally seen;"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"but it rapidly disappeared in sinister gloom. Then the Balkan War broke"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"out; and therewith the first gusts of the forthcoming tornado swept"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"across a highly-strung Europe. In the supervening calm men felt the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"atmosphere oppressive and foreboding, so much so that the sense of an"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"impending catastrophe became transformed into a feeling of impatient"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"expectance. They wished that Heaven would give free rein to the fate"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"which could now no longer be curbed. Then the first great bolt of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"lightning struck the earth. The storm broke and the thunder of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"heavens intermingled with the roar of the cannons in the World War."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"When the news came to Munich that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"murdered, I had been at home all day and did not get the particulars of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"how it happened. At first I feared that the shots may have been fired by"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"some German-Austrian students who had been aroused to a state of furious"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"indignation by the persistent pro-Slav activities of the Heir to the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Habsburg Throne and therefore wished to liberate the German population"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"from this internal enemy. It was quite easy to imagine what the result"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of such a mistake would have been. It would have brought on a new wave"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of persecution, the motives of which would have been 'justified' before"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the whole world. But soon afterwards I heard the names of the presumed"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"assassins and also that they were known to be Serbs. I felt somewhat"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dumbfounded in face of the inexorable vengeance which Destiny had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"wrought. The greatest friend of the Slavs had fallen a victim to the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"bullets of Slav patriots."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"It is unjust to the Vienna government of that time to blame it now for"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the form and tenor of the ultimatum which was then presented. In a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"similar position and under similar circumstances, no other Power in the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"world would have acted otherwise. On her southern frontiers Austria had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a relentless mortal foe who indulged in acts of provocation against the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Dual Monarchy at intervals which were becoming more and more frequent."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"This persistent line of conduct would not have been relaxed until the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"arrival of the opportune moment for the destruction of the Empire. In"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Austria there was good reason to fear that, at the latest, this moment"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"would come with the death of the old Emperor. Once that had taken place,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"it was quite possible that the Monarchy would not be able to offer any"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"serious resistance. For some years past the State had been so completely"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"identified with the personality of Francis Joseph that, in the eyes of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the great mass of the people, the death of this venerable"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"personification of the Empire would be tantamount to the death of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Empire itself. Indeed it was one of the clever artifices of Slav policy"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to foster the impression that the Austrian State owed its very existence"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"exclusively to the prodigies and rare talents of that monarch. This kind"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of flattery was particularly welcomed at the Hofburg, all the more"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"because it had no relation whatsoever to the services actually rendered"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"by the Emperor. No effort whatsoever was made to locate the carefully"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"prepared sting which lay hidden in this glorifying praise. One fact"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"which was entirely overlooked, perhaps intentionally, was that the more"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the Empire remained dependent on the so-called administrative talents of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"'the wisest Monarch of all times', the more catastrophic would be the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"situation when Fate came to knock at the door and demand its tribute."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Was it possible even to imagine the Austrian Empire without its"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"venerable ruler? Would not the tragedy which befell Maria Theresa be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"repeated at once?"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"It is really unjust to the Vienna governmental circles to reproach them"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"with having instigated a war which might have been prevented. The war"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"was bound to come. Perhaps it might have been postponed for a year or"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"two at the most. But it had always been the misfortune of German, as"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"well as Austrian, diplomats that they endeavoured to put off the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"inevitable day of reckoning, with the result that they were finally"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"compelled to deliver their blow at a most inopportune moment."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"No. Those who did not wish this war ought to have had the courage to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"take the consequences of the refusal upon themselves. Those consequences"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"must necessarily have meant the sacrifice of Austria. And even then war"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"would have come, not as a war in which all the nations would have been"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"banded against us but in the form of a dismemberment of the Habsburg"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Monarchy. In that case we should have had to decide whether we should"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"come to the assistance of the Habsburg or stand aside as spectators,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"with our arms folded, and thus allow Fate to run its course."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Just those who are loudest in their imprecations to-day and make a great"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"parade of wisdom in judging the causes of the war are the very same"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"people whose collaboration was the most fatal factor in steering towards"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the war."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"For several decades previously the German Social-Democrats had been"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"agitating in an underhand and knavish way for war against Russia;"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"whereas the German Centre Party, with religious ends in view, had worked"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to make the Austrian State the chief centre and turning-point of German"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"policy. The consequences of this folly had now to be borne. What came"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"was bound to come and under no circumstances could it have been avoided."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The fault of the German Government lay in the fact that, merely for the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"sake of preserving peace at all costs, it continued to miss the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"occasions that were favourable for action, got entangled in an alliance"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"for the purpose of preserving the peace of the world, and thus finally"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"became the victim of a world coalition which opposed the German effort"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"for the maintenance of peace and was determined to bring about the world"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"war."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Had the Vienna Government of that time formulated its ultimatum in less"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"drastic terms, that would not have altered the situation at all: but"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"such a course might have aroused public indignation. For, in the eyes of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the great masses, the ultimatum was too moderate and certainly not"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"excessive or brutal. Those who would deny this to-day are either"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"simpletons with feeble memories or else deliberate falsehood-mongers."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The War of 1914 was certainly not forced on the masses; it was even"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"desired by the whole people."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"There was a desire to bring the general feeling of uncertainty to an end"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"once and for all. And it is only in the light of this fact that we can"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"understand how more than two million German men and youths voluntarily"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"joined the colours, ready to shed the last drop of their blood for the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"cause."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"For me these hours came as a deliverance from the distress that had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"weighed upon me during the days of my youth. I am not ashamed to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"acknowledge to-day that I was carried away by the enthusiasm of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"moment and that I sank down upon my knees and thanked Heaven out of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fullness of my heart for the favour of having been permitted to live in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"such a time."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The fight for freedom had broken out on an unparalleled scale in the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"history of the world. From the moment that Fate took the helm in hand"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the conviction grew among the mass of the people that now it was not a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"question of deciding the destinies of Austria or Serbia but that the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"very existence of the German nation itself was at stake."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"At last, after many years of blindness, the people saw clearly into the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"future. Therefore, almost immediately after the gigantic struggle had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"begun, an excessive enthusiasm was replaced by a more earnest and more"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fitting undertone, because the exaltation of the popular spirit was not"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a mere passing frenzy. It was only too necessary that the gravity of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"situation should be recognized. At that time there was, generally"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"speaking, not the slightest presentiment or conception of how long the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"war might last. People dreamed of the soldiers being home by Christmas"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"and that then they would resume their daily work in peace."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Whatever mankind desires, that it will hope for and believe in. The"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"overwhelming majority of the people had long since grown weary of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"perpetual insecurity in the general condition of public affairs. Hence"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"it was only natural that no one believed that the Austro-Serbian"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"conflict could be shelved. Therefore they looked forward to a radical"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"settlement of accounts. I also belonged to the millions that desired"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"this."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The moment the news of the Sarajevo outrage reached Munich two ideas"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"came into my mind: First, that war was absolutely inevitable and,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"second, that the Habsburg State would now be forced to honour its"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"signature to the alliance. For what I had feared most was that one day"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Germany herself, perhaps as a result of the Alliance, would become"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"involved in a conflict the first direct cause of which did not affect"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Austria. In such a contingency, I feared that the Austrian State, for"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"domestic political reasons, would find itself unable to decide in favour"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of its ally. But now this danger was removed. The old State was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"compelled to fight, whether it wished to do so or not."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"My own attitude towards the conflict was equally simple and clear. I"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"believed that it was not a case of Austria fighting to get satisfaction"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"from Serbia but rather a case of Germany fighting for her own"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"existence--the German nation for its own to-be-or-not-to-be, for its"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"freedom and for its future. The work of Bismarck must now be carried on."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Young Germany must show itself worthy of the blood shed by our fathers"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"on so many heroic fields of battle, from Weissenburg to Sedan and Paris."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"And if this struggle should bring us victory our people will again rank"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"foremost among the great nations. Only then could the German Empire"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"assert itself as the mighty champion of peace, without the necessity of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"restricting the daily bread of its children for the sake of maintaining"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the peace."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"As a boy and as a young man, I often longed for the occasion to prove"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"that my national enthusiasm was not mere vapouring. Hurrahing sometimes"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"seemed to me to be a kind of sinful indulgence, though I could not give"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"any justification for that feeling; for, after all, who has the right to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"shout that triumphant word if he has not won the right to it there where"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"there is no play-acting and where the hand of the Goddess of Destiny"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"puts the truth and sincerity of nations and men through her inexorable"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"test? Just as millions of others, I felt a proud joy in being permitted"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to go through this test. I had so often sung DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"so often roared 'HEIL' that I now thought it was as a kind of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"retro-active grace that I was granted the right of appearing before the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Court of Eternal Justice to testify to the truth of those sentiments."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"One thing was clear to me from the very beginning, namely, that in the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"event of war, which now seemed inevitable, my books would have to be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"thrown aside forthwith. I also realized that my place would have to be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"there where the inner voice of conscience called me."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"I had left Austria principally for political reasons. What therefore"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"could be more rational than that I should put into practice the logical"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"consequences of my political opinions, now that the war had begun. I had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"no desire to fight for the Habsburg cause, but I was prepared to die at"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"any time for my own kinsfolk and the Empire to which they really"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"belonged."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"On August 3rd, 1914, I presented an urgent petition to His Majesty, King"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Ludwig III, requesting to be allowed to serve in a Bavarian regiment. In"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"those days the Chancellery had its hands quite full and therefore I was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"all the more pleased when I received the answer a day later, that my"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"request had been granted. I opened the document with trembling hands;"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"and no words of mine could now describe the satisfaction I felt on"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"reading that I was instructed to report to a Bavarian regiment. Within a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"few days I was wearing that uniform which I was not to put oft again for"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"nearly six years."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"For me, as for every German, the most memorable period of my life now"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"began. Face to face with that mighty struggle, all the past fell away"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"into oblivion. With a wistful pride I look back on those days,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"especially because we are now approaching the tenth anniversary of that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"memorable happening. I recall those early weeks of war when kind fortune"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"permitted me to take my place in that heroic struggle among the nations."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"As the scene unfolds itself before my mind, it seems only like"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"yesterday. I see myself among my young comrades on our first parade"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"drill, and so on until at last the day came on which we were to leave"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"for the front."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"In common with the others, I had one worry during those days. This was a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fear that we might arrive too late for the fighting at the front. Time"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"and again that thought disturbed me and every announcement of a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"victorious engagement left a bitter taste, which increased as the news"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of further victories arrived."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"At long last the day came when we left Munich on war service. For the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"first time in my life I saw the Rhine, as we journeyed westwards to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"stand guard before that historic German river against its traditional"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"and grasping enemy. As the first soft rays of the morning sun broke"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"through the light mist and disclosed to us the Niederwald Statue, with"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"one accord the whole troop train broke into the strains of DIE WACHT AM"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"RHEIN. I then felt as if my heart could not contain its spirit."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"And then followed a damp, cold night in Flanders. We marched in silence"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"throughout the night and as the morning sun came through the mist an"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"iron greeting suddenly burst above our heads. Shrapnel exploded in our"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"midst and spluttered in the damp ground. But before the smoke of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"explosion disappeared a wild 'Hurrah' was shouted from two hundred"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"throats, in response to this first greeting of Death. Then began the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"whistling of bullets and the booming of cannons, the shouting and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"singing of the combatants. With eyes straining feverishly, we pressed"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"forward, quicker and quicker, until we finally came to close-quarter"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fighting, there beyond the beet-fields and the meadows. Soon the strains"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of a song reached us from afar. Nearer and nearer, from company to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"company, it came. And while Death began to make havoc in our ranks we"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"passed the song on to those beside us: DEUTSCHLAND, DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"ALLES, ÜBER ALLES IN DER WELT."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"After four days in the trenches we came back. Even our step was no"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"longer what it had been. Boys of seventeen looked now like grown men."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The rank and file of the List Regiment (Note 11) had not been properly"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"trained in the art of warfare, but they knew how to die like old soldiers."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"[Note 11. The Second Infantry Bavarian Regiment, in which Hitler served"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"as a volunteer.]"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"That was the beginning. And thus we carried on from year to year. A"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"feeling of horror replaced the romantic fighting spirit. Enthusiasm"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"cooled down gradually and exuberant spirits were quelled by the fear of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the ever-present Death. A time came when there arose within each one of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"us a conflict between the urge to self-preservation and the call of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"duty. And I had to go through that conflict too. As Death sought its"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"prey everywhere and unrelentingly a nameless Something rebelled within"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the weak body and tried to introduce itself under the name of Common"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Sense; but in reality it was Fear, which had taken on this cloak in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"order to impose itself on the individual. But the more the voice which"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"advised prudence increased its efforts and the more clear and persuasive"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"became its appeal, resistance became all the stronger; until finally the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"internal strife was over and the call of duty was triumphant. Already in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the winter of 1915-16 I had come through that inner struggle. The will"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"had asserted its incontestable mastery. Whereas in the early days I went"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"into the fight with a cheer and a laugh, I was now habitually calm and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"resolute. And that frame of mind endured. Fate might now put me through"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the final test without my nerves or reason giving way. The young"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"volunteer had become an old soldier."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"This same transformation took place throughout the whole army. Constant"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fighting had aged and toughened it and hardened it, so that it stood"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"firm and dauntless against every assault."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Only now was it possible to judge that army. After two and three years"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of continuous fighting, having been thrown into one battle after"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"another, standing up stoutly against superior numbers and superior"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"armament, suffering hunger and privation, the time had come when one"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"could assess the value of that singular fighting force."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"For a thousand years to come nobody will dare to speak of heroism"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"without recalling the German Army of the World War. And then from the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dim past will emerge the immortal vision of those solid ranks of steel"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"helmets that never flinched and never faltered. And as long as Germans"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"live they will be proud to remember that these men were the sons of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"their forefathers."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"I was then a soldier and did not wish to meddle in politics, all the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"more so because the time was inopportune. I still believe that the most"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"modest stable-boy of those days served his country better than the best"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of, let us say, the 'parliamentary deputies'. My hatred for those"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"footlers was never greater than in those days when all decent men who"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"had anything to say said it point-blank in the enemy's face; or, failing"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"this, kept their mouths shut and did their duty elsewhere. I despised"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"those political fellows and if I had had my way I would have formed them"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"into a Labour Battalion and given them the opportunity of babbling"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"amongst themselves to their hearts' content, without offence or harm to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"decent people."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"In those days I cared nothing for politics; but I could not help forming"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"an opinion on certain manifestations which affected not only the whole"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"nation but also us soldiers in particular. There were two things which"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"caused me the greatest anxiety at that time and which I had come to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"

"under the mask of good intentions and a spirit of anxious care. The"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"public was told that big celebrations of victories were somewhat out of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"place and were not worthy expressions of the spirit of a great nation."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The fortitude and valour of German soldiers were accepted facts which"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"did not necessarily call for outbursts of celebration. Furthermore, it"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"was asked, what would foreign opinion have to say about these"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"manifestations? Would not foreign opinion react more favourably to a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"quiet and sober form of celebration rather than to all this wild"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"jubilation? Surely the time had come--so the Press declared--for us"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Germans to remember that this war was not our work and that hence there"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"need be no feeling of shame in declaring our willingness to do our share"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"towards effecting an understanding among the nations. For this reason it"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"would not be wise to sully the radiant deeds of our army with unbecoming"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"jubilation; for the rest of the world would never understand this."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Furthermore, nothing is more appreciated than the modesty with which a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"

"gist of their warning."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Instead of catching these fellows by their long ears and dragging them"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to some ditch and looping a cord around their necks, so that the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"

"and 'undignified' forms of victorious celebration."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"No one seemed to have the faintest idea that when public enthusiasm is"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"once damped, nothing can enkindle it again, when the necessity arises."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"This enthusiasm is an intoxication and must be kept up in that form."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Without the support of this enthusiastic spirit how would it be possible"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to endure in a struggle which, according to human standards, made such"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"immense demands on the spiritual stamina of the nation?"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"I was only too well acquainted with the psychology of the broad masses"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"not to know that in such cases a magnaminous 'aestheticism' cannot fan"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the fire which is needed to keep the iron hot. In my eyes it was even a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"mistake not to have tried to raise the pitch of public enthusiasm still"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"higher. Therefore I could not at all understand why the contrary policy"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"was adopted, that is to say, the policy of damping the public spirit."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Another thing which irritated me was the manner in which Marxism was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"regarded and accepted. I thought that all this proved how little they"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"knew about the Marxist plague. It was believed in all seriousness that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the abolition of party distinctions during the War had made Marxism a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"mild and moderate thing."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But here there was no question of party. There was question of a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"doctrine which was being expounded for the express purpose of leading"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"humanity to its destruction. The purport of this doctrine was not"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"understood because nothing was said about that side of the question in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"our Jew-ridden universities and because our supercilious bureaucratic"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"officials did not think it worth while to read up a subject which had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"not been prescribed in their university course. This mighty"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"revolutionary trend was going on beside them; but those 'intellectuals'"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"would not deign to give it their attention. That is why State enterprise"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"

"truly say that their maxim is: What we don't know won't bother us. In"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the August of 1914 the German worker was looked upon as an adherent of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Marxist socialism. That was a gross error. When those fateful hours"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dawned the German worker shook off the poisonous clutches of that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"plague; otherwise he would not have been so willing and ready to fight."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"And people were stupid enough to imagine that Marxism had now become"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"'national', another apt illustration of the fact that those in authority"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"had never taken the trouble to study the real tenor of the Marxist"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"teaching. If they had done so, such foolish errors would not have been"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"committed."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Marxism, whose final objective was and is and will continue to be the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"destruction of all non-Jewish national States, had to witness in those"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"days of July 1914 how the German working classes, which it had been"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"inveigling, were aroused by the national spirit and rapidly ranged"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"themselves on the side of the Fatherland. Within a few days the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"deceptive smoke-screen of that infamous national betrayal had vanished"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"into thin air and the Jewish bosses suddenly found themselves alone and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"deserted. It was as if not a vestige had been left of that folly and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"madness with which the masses of the German people had been inoculated"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"for sixty years. That was indeed an evil day for the betrayers of German"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Labour. The moment, however, that the leaders realized the danger which"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"threatened them they pulled the magic cap of deceit over their ears and,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"without being identified, played the part of mimes in the national"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"reawakening."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The time seemed to have arrived for proceeding against the whole Jewish"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"gang of public pests. Then it was that action should have been taken"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"regardless of any consequent whining or protestation. At one stroke, in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the August of 1914, all the empty nonsense about international"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"solidarity was knocked out of the heads of the German working classes. A"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"few weeks later, instead of this stupid talk sounding in their ears,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"they heard the noise of American-manufactured shrapnel bursting above"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the heads of the marching columns, as a symbol of international"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"comradeship. Now that the German worker had rediscovered the road to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"nationhood, it ought to have been the duty of any Government which had"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the care of the people in its keeping, to take this opportunity of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"mercilessly rooting out everything that was opposed to the national"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"spirit."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"While the flower of the nation's manhood was dying at the front, there"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"was time enough at home at least to exterminate this vermin. But,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"instead of doing so, His Majesty the Kaiser held out his hand to these"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"hoary criminals, thus assuring them his protection and allowing them to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"regain their mental composure."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"And so the viper could begin his work again. This time, however, more"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"carefully than before, but still more destructively. While honest people"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dreamt of reconciliation these perjured criminals were making"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"preparations for a revolution."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Naturally I was distressed at the half-measures which were adopted at"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"that time; but I never thought it possible that the final consequences"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"could have been so disastrous?"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But what should have been done then? Throw the ringleaders into gaol,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"prosecute them and rid the nation of them? Uncompromising military"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"measures should have been adopted to root out the evil. Parties should"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"have been abolished and the Reichstag brought to its senses at the point"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of the bayonet, if necessary. It would have been still better if the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Reichstag had been dissolved immediately. Just as the Republic to-day"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dissolves the parties when it wants to, so in those days there was even"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"more justification for applying that measure, seeing that the very"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"existence of the nation was at stake. Of course this suggestion would"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"give rise to the question: Is it possible to eradicate ideas by force of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"arms? Could a WELTANSCHAUUNG be attacked by means of physical force?"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"At that time I turned these questions over and over again in my mind. By"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"studying analogous cases, exemplified in history, particularly those"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"which had arisen from religious circumstances, I came to the following"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fundamental conclusion:"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Ideas and philosophical systems as well as movements grounded on a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"definite spiritual foundation, whether true or not, can never be broken"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"by the use of force after a certain stage, except on one condition:"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"namely, that this use of force is in the service of a new idea or"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"WELTANSCHAUUNG which burns with a new flame."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The application of force alone, without moral support based on a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"spiritual concept, can never bring about the destruction of an idea or"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"arrest the propagation of it, unless one is ready and able ruthlessly to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"exterminate the last upholders of that idea even to a man, and also wipe"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"out any tradition which it may tend to leave behind. Now in the majority"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of cases the result of such a course has been to exclude such a State,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"either temporarily or for ever, from the comity of States that are of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"political significance; but experience has also shown that such a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"sanguinary method of extirpation arouses the better section of the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"population under the persecuting power. As a matter of fact, every"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"persecution which has no spiritual motives to support it is morally"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"unjust and raises opposition among the best elements of the population;"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"so much so that these are driven more and more to champion the ideas"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"that are unjustly persecuted. With many individuals this arises from the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"sheer spirit of opposition to every attempt at suppressing spiritual"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"things by brute force."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"In this way the number of convinced adherents of the persecuted doctrine"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"increases as the persecution progresses. Hence the total destruction of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a new doctrine can be accomplished only by a vast plan of extermination;"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"but this, in the final analysis, means the loss of some of the best"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"blood in a nation or State. And that blood is then avenged, because such"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"an internal and total clean-up brings about the collapse of the nation's"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"strength. And such a procedure is always condemned to futility from the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"very start if the attacked doctrine should happen to have spread beyond"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a small circle."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"That is why in this case, as with all other growths, the doctrine can be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"exterminated in its earliest stages. As time goes on its powers of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"resistance increase, until at the approach of age it gives way to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"younger elements, but under another form and from other motives."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The fact remains that nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"without having some spiritual basis of attack against it, and also to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"wipe out all the organizations it has created, have led in many cases to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the very opposite being achieved; and that for the following reasons:"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"When sheer force is used to combat the spread of a doctrine, then that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"force must be employed systematically and persistently. This means that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the chances of success in the suppression of a doctrine lie only in the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"persistent and uniform application of the methods chosen. The moment"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"hesitation is shown, and periods of tolerance alternate with the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"application of force, the doctrine against which these measures are"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"directed will not only recover strength but every successive persecution"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"will bring to its support new adherents who have been shocked by the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"oppressive methods employed. The old adherents will become more"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"embittered and their allegiance will thereby be strengthened. Therefore"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"when force is employed success is dependent on the consistent manner in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"which it is used. This persistence, however, is nothing less than the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"product of definite spiritual convictions. Every form of force that is"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"not supported by a spiritual backing will be always indecisive and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"uncertain. Such a force lacks the stability that can be found only in a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"WELTANSCHAUUNG which has devoted champions. Such a force is the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"expression of the individual energies; therefore it is from time to time"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"dependent on the change of persons in whose hands it is employed and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"also on their characters and capacities."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But there is something else to be said: Every WELTANSCHAUUNG, whether"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"religious or political--and it is sometimes difficult to say where the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"one ends and the other begins--fights not so much for the negative"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"destruction of the opposing world of ideas as for the positive"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"realization of its own ideas. Thus its struggle lies in attack rather"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"than in defence. It has the advantage of knowing where its objective"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"lies, as this objective represents the realization of its own ideas."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Inversely, it is difficult to say when the negative aim for the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"destruction of a hostile doctrine is reached and secured. For this"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"reason alone a WELTANSCHAUUNG which is of an aggressive character is"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"more definite in plan and more powerful and decisive in action than a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"WELTANSCHAUUNG which takes up a merely defensive attitude. If force be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"used to combat a spiritual power, that force remains a defensive measure"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"only so long as the wielders of it are not the standard-bearers and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"apostles of a new spiritual doctrine."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"To sum up, the following must be borne in mind: That every attempt to"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"combat a WELTANSCHAUUNG by means of force will turn out futile in the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"end if the struggle fails to take the form of an offensive for the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"establishment of an entirely new spiritual order of' things. It is only"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"in the struggle between two Weltan-schauungen that physical force,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"consistently and ruthlessly applied, will eventually turn the scales in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"its own favour. It was here that the fight against Marxism had hitherto"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"failed."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"This was also the reason why Bismarck's anti-socialist legislation"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"failed and was bound to fail in the long run, despite everything. It"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"lacked the basis of a new WELTANSCHAUUNG for whose development and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"extension the struggle might have been taken up. To say that the serving"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"up of drivel about a so-called 'State-Authority' or 'Law-and-Order' was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"an adequate foundation for the spiritual driving force in a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"life-or-death struggle is only what one would expect to hear from the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"wiseacres in high official positions."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"It was because there were no adequate spiritual motives back of this"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"offensive that Bismarck was compelled to hand over the administration of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"his socialist legislative measures to the judgment and approval of those"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"circles which were themselves the product of the Marxist teaching. Thus"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a very ludicrous state of affairs prevailed when the Iron Chancellor"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"surrendered the fate of his struggle against Marxism to the goodwill of"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the bourgeois democracy. He left the goat to take care of the garden."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But this was only the necessary result of the failure to find a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fundamentally new WELTANSCHAUUNG which would attract devoted champions"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to its cause and could be established on the ground from which Marxism"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"had been driven out. And thus the result of the Bismarckian campaign was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"deplorable."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"During the World War, or at the beginning of it, were the conditions any"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"different? Unfortunately, they were not."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The more I then pondered over the necessity for a change in the attitude"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of the executive government towards Social-Democracy, as the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"incorporation of contemporary Marxism, the more I realized the want of a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"practical substitute for this doctrine. Supposing Social-Democracy were"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"overthrown, what had one to offer the masses in its stead? Not a single"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"movement existed which promised any success in attracting vast numbers"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"of workers who would be now more or less without leaders, and holding"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"these workers in its train. It is nonsensical to imagine that the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"international fanatic who has just severed his connection with a class"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"party would forthwith join a bourgeois party, or, in other words,"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"another class organization. For however unsatisfactory these various"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"organizations may appear to be, it cannot be denied that bourgeois"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"politicians look on the distinction between classes as a very important"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"factor in social life, provided it does not turn out politically"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"disadvantageous to them. If they deny this fact they show themselves not"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"only impudent but also mendacious."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Generally speaking, one should guard against considering the broad"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"masses more stupid than they really are. In political matters it"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"frequently happens that feeling judges more correctly than intellect."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But the opinion that this feeling on the part of the masses is"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"sufficient proof of their stupid international attitude can be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"immediately and definitely refuted by the simple fact that pacifist"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"democracy is no less fatuous, though it draws its supporters almost"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"exclusively from bourgeois circles. As long as millions of citizens"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"daily gulp down what the social-democratic Press tells them, it ill"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"becomes the 'Masters' to joke at the expense of the 'Comrades'; for in"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the long run they all swallow the same hash, even though it be dished up"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"with different spices. In both cases the cook is one and the same--the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Jew."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"One should be careful about contradicting established facts. It is an"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"undeniable fact that the class question has nothing to do with questions"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"concerning ideals, though that dope is administered at election time."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Class arrogance among a large section of our people, as well as a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"prevailing tendency to look down on the manual labourer, are obvious"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"facts and not the fancies of some day-dreamer. Nevertheless it only"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"illustrates the mentality of our so-called intellectual circles, that"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"they have not yet grasped the fact that circumstances which are"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"incapable of preventing the growth of such a plague as Marxism are"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"certainly not capable of restoring what has been lost."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"The bourgeois' parties--a name coined by themselves--will never again be"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"able to win over and hold the proletarian masses in their train. That is"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"because two worlds stand opposed to one another here, in part naturally"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"and in part artificially divided. These two camps have one leading"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"thought, and that is that they must fight one another. But in such a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fight the younger will come off victorious; and that is Marxism."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"In 1914 a fight against Social-Democracy was indeed quite conceivable."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"But the lack of any practical substitute made it doubtful how long the"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"fight could be kept up. In this respect there was a gaping void."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"Long before the War I was of the same opinion and that was the reason"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"why I could not decide to join any of the parties then existing. During"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the course of the World War my conviction was still further confirmed by"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"the manifest impossibility of fighting Social-Democracy in anything like"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"a thorough way: because for that purpose there should have been a"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"movement that was something more than a mere 'parliamentary' party, and"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"there was none such."	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"I frequently discussed that want with my intimate comrades. And it was"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"then that I first conceived the idea of taking up political work later"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"on. As I have often assured my friends, it was just this that induced me"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"
"to become active on the public hustings after the War, in addition to my"	"CHAPTER VI   WAR PROPAGANDA"

"In watching the course of political events I was always struck by the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"active part which propaganda played in them. I saw that it was an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"instrument, which the Marxist Socialists knew how to handle in a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"masterly way and how to put it to practical uses. Thus I soon came to"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"realize that the right use of propaganda was an art in itself and that"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"this art was practically unknown to our bourgeois parties. The"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"

"system of information--a failure which was perfectly obvious to every"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"soldier--that urged me to consider the problem of propaganda in a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"comprehensive way. I had ample opportunity to learn a practical lesson"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"in this matter; for unfortunately it was only too well taught us by the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"enemy. The lack on our side was exploited by the enemy in such an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"efficient manner that one could say it showed itself as a real work of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"genius. In that propaganda carried on by the enemy I found admirable"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"sources of instruction. The lesson to be learned from this had"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"unfortunately no attraction for the geniuses on our own side. They were"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"simply above all such things, too clever to accept any teaching. Anyhow"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"they did not honestly wish to learn anything."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Had we any propaganda at all? Alas, I can reply only in the negative."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"All that was undertaken in this direction was so utterly inadequate and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"misconceived from the very beginning that not only did it prove useless"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"but at times harmful. In substance it was insufficient. Psychologically"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"it was all wrong. Anybody who had carefully investigated the German"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda must have formed that judgment of it. Our people did not seem"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"to be clear even about the primary question itself: Whether propaganda"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is a means or an end?"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Propaganda is a means and must, therefore, be judged in relation to the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"end it is intended to serve. It must be organized in such a way as to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"capable of attaining its objective. And, as it is quite clear that the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"importance of the objective may vary from the standpoint of general"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"necessity, the essential internal character of the propaganda must vary"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"accordingly. The cause for which we fought during the War was the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"noblest and highest that man could strive for. We were fighting for the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"freedom and independence of our country, for the security of our future"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"welfare and the honour of the nation. Despite all views to the contrary,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"this honour does actually exist, or rather it will have to exist; for a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"nation without honour will sooner or later lose its freedom and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"independence. This is in accordance with the ruling of a higher justice,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"for a generation of poltroons is not entitled to freedom. He who would"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"be a slave cannot have honour; for such honour would soon become an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"object of general scorn."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Germany was waging war for its very existence. The purpose of its war"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda should have been to strengthen the fighting spirit in that"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"struggle and help it to victory."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"But when nations are fighting for their existence on this earth, when"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the question of 'to be or not to be' has to be answered, then all humane"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"and aesthetic considerations must be set aside; for these ideals do not"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"exist of themselves somewhere in the air but are the product of man's"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"creative imagination and disappear when he disappears. Nature knows"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"nothing of them. Moreover, they are characteristic of only a small"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"number of nations, or rather of races, and their value depends on the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"measure in which they spring from the racial feeling of the latter."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Humane and aesthetic ideals will disappear from the inhabited earth when"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"those races disappear which are the creators and standard-bearers of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"them."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"All such ideals are only of secondary importance when a nation is"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"struggling for its existence. They must be prevented from entering into"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the struggle the moment they threaten to weaken the stamina of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"nation that is waging war. That is always the only visible effect"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"whereby their place in the struggle is to be judged."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"In regard to the part played by humane feeling, Moltke stated that in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"time of war the essential thing is to get a decision as quickly as"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"possible and that the most ruthless methods of fighting are at the same"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"time the most humane. When people attempt to answer this reasoning by"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"highfalutin talk about aesthetics, etc., only one answer can be given. It"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is that the vital questions involved in the struggle of a nation for its"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"existence must not be subordinated to any aesthetic considerations. The"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"yoke of slavery is and always will remain the most unpleasant experience"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"that mankind can endure. Do the Schwabing (Note 12) decadents look upon"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Germany's lot to-day as 'aesthetic'? Of course, one doesn't discuss such"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"a question with the Jews, because they are the modern inventors of this"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"cultural perfume. Their very existence is an incarnate denial of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"beauty of God's image in His creation."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"[Note 12. Schwabing is the artistic quarter in Munich where artists have"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"their studios and litterateurs, especially of the Bohemian class,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"foregather.]"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Since these ideas of what is beautiful and humane have no place in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"warfare, they are not to be used as standards of war propaganda."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"During the War, propaganda was a means to an end. And this end was the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"struggle for existence of the German nation. Propaganda, therefore,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"should have been regarded from the standpoint of its utility for that"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"purpose. The most cruel weapons were then the most humane, provided they"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"helped towards a speedier decision; and only those methods were good and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"beautiful which helped towards securing the dignity and freedom of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"nation. Such was the only possible attitude to adopt towards war"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda in the life-or-death struggle."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"If those in what are called positions of authority had realized this"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"there would have been no uncertainty about the form and employment of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"war propaganda as a weapon; for it is nothing but a weapon, and indeed a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"most terrifying weapon in the hands of those who know how to use it."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The second question of decisive importance is this: To whom should"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda be made to appeal? To the educated intellectual classes? Or"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"to the less intellectual?"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"For the intellectual classes, or what are called the intellectual"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"classes to-day, propaganda is not suited, but only scientific"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"exposition. Propaganda has as little to do with science as an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"advertisement poster has to do with art, as far as concerns the form in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"which it presents its message. The art of the advertisement poster"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"consists in the ability of the designer to attract the attention of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"crowd through the form and colours he chooses. The advertisement poster"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"announcing an exhibition of art has no other aim than to convince the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"public of the importance of the exhibition. The better it does that, the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"better is the art of the poster as such. Being meant accordingly to"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"impress upon the public the meaning of the exposition, the poster can"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"never take the place of the artistic objects displayed in the exposition"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"hall. They are something entirely different. Therefore. those who wish"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"to study the artistic display must study something that is quite"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"different from the poster; indeed for that purpose a mere wandering"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"through the exhibition galleries is of no use. The student of art must"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"carefully and thoroughly study each exhibit in order slowly to form a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"judicious opinion about it."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The situation is the same in regard to what we understand by the word,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda. The purpose of propaganda is not the personal instruction of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the individual, but rather to attract public attention to certain"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"things, the importance of which can be brought home to the masses only"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"by this means."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Here the art of propaganda consists in putting a matter so clearly and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"forcibly before the minds of the people as to create a general"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"conviction regarding the reality of a certain fact, the necessity of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"certain things and the just character of something that is essential."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"But as this art is not an end in itself and because its purpose must be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"exactly that of the advertisement poster, to attract the attention of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the masses and not by any means to dispense individual instructions to"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"those who already have an educated opinion on things or who wish to form"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"such an opinion on grounds of objective study--because that is not the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"purpose of propaganda, it must appeal to the feelings of the public"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"rather than to their reasoning powers."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"intellectual of those to whom it is directed. Thus its purely"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"intellectual level will have to be that of the lowest mental common"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"denominator among the public it is desired to reach. When there is"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"question of bringing a whole nation within the circle of its influence,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"as happens in the case of war propaganda, then too much attention cannot"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"be paid to the necessity of avoiding a high level, which presupposes a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"relatively high degree of intelligence among the public."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The more modest the scientific tenor of this propaganda and the more it"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is addressed exclusively to public sentiment, the more decisive will be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"its success. This is the best test of the value of a propaganda, and not"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the approbation of a small group of intellectuals or artistic people."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings, in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses. That this is"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"not understood by those among us whose wits are supposed to have been"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"sharpened to the highest pitch is only another proof of their vanity or"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"mental inertia."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Once we have understood how necessary it is to concentrate the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"persuasive forces of propaganda on the broad masses of the people, the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"following lessons result therefrom:"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"That it is a mistake to organize the direct propaganda as if it were a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"manifold system of scientific instruction."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"being the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"essentials and those must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"formulas. These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward. If"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"this principle be forgotten and if an attempt be made to be abstract and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"general, the propaganda will turn out ineffective; for the public will"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"not be able to digest or retain what is offered to them in this way."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Therefore, the greater the scope of the message that has to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"presented, the more necessary it is for the propaganda to discover that"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"plan of action which is psychologically the most efficient."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"It was, for example, a fundamental mistake to ridicule the worth of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"enemy as the Austrian and German comic papers made a chief point of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"doing in their propaganda. The very principle here is a mistaken one;"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"for, when they came face to face with the enemy, our soldiers had quite"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"a different impression. Therefore, the mistake had disastrous results."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Once the German soldier realised what a tough enemy he had to fight he"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"felt that he had been deceived by the manufacturers of the information"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"which had been given him. Therefore, instead of strengthening and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"stimulating his fighting spirit, this information had quite the contrary"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"effect. Finally he lost heart."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"On the other hand, British and American war propaganda was"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"psychologically efficient. By picturing the Germans to their own people"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"as Barbarians and Huns, they were preparing their soldiers for the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"horrors of war and safeguarding them against illusions. The most"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"terrific weapons which those soldiers encountered in the field merely"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"confirmed the information that they had already received and their"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"belief in the truth of the assertions made by their respective"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"governments was accordingly reinforced. Thus their rage and hatred"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"against the infamous foe was increased. The terrible havoc caused by the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"German weapons of war was only another illustration of the Hunnish"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"brutality of those barbarians; whereas on the side of the Entente no"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"time was left the soldiers to meditate on the similar havoc which their"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"own weapons were capable of. Thus the British soldier was never allowed"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"to feel that the information which he received at home was untrue."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Unfortunately the opposite was the case with the Germans, who finally"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"wound up by rejecting everything from home as pure swindle and humbug."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"This result was made possible because at home they thought that the work"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"of propaganda could be entrusted to the first ass that came along,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"braying of his own special talents, and they had no conception of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"fact that propaganda demands the most skilled brains that can be found."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Thus the German war propaganda afforded us an incomparable example of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"how the work of 'enlightenment' should not be done and how such an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"example was the result of an entire failure to take any psychological"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"considerations whatsoever into account."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"From the enemy, however, a fund of valuable knowledge could be gained by"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"those who kept their eyes open, whose powers of perception had not yet"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"become sclerotic, and who during four-and-a-half years had to experience"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the perpetual flood of enemy propaganda."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The worst of all was that our people did not understand the very first"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"condition which has to be fulfilled in every kind of propaganda; namely,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"a systematically one-sided attitude towards every problem that has to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"dealt with. In this regard so many errors were committed, even from the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"very beginning of the war, that it was justifiable to doubt whether so"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"much folly could be attributed solely to the stupidity of people in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"higher quarters."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"What, for example, should we say of a poster which purported to"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"advertise some new brand of soap by insisting on the excellent qualities"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"of the competitive brands? We should naturally shake our heads. And it"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"ought to be just the same in a similar kind of political advertisement."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The aim of propaganda is not to try to pass judgment on conflicting"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"rights, giving each its due, but exclusively to emphasize the right"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"which we are asserting. Propaganda must not investigate the truth"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"objectively and, in so far as it is favourable to the other side,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"present it according to the theoretical rules of justice; yet it must"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"present only that aspect of the truth which is favourable to its own"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"side."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"It was a fundamental mistake to discuss the question of who was"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"responsible for the outbreak of the war and declare that the sole"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"responsibility could not be attributed to Germany. The sole"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"responsibility should have been laid on the shoulders of the enemy,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"without any discussion whatsoever."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"And what was the consequence of these half-measures? The broad masses of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"judgment in given cases, but a vacillating crowd of human children who"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"are constantly wavering between one idea and another. As soon as our own"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda made the slightest suggestion that the enemy had a certain"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"amount of justice on his side, then we laid down the basis on which the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"justice of our own cause could be questioned. The masses are not in a"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"position to discern where the enemy's fault ends and where our own"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"begins. In such a case they become hesitant and distrustful, especially"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"when the enemy does not make the same mistake but heaps all the blame on"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"his adversary. Could there be any clearer proof of this than the fact"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"that finally our own people believed what was said by the enemy's"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda, which was uniform and consistent in its assertions, rather"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"than what our own propaganda said? And that, of course, was increased by"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the mania for objectivity which addicts our people. Everybody began to"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"be careful about doing an injustice to the enemy, even at the cost of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"seriously injuring, and even ruining his own people and State."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Naturally the masses were not conscious of the fact that those in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"authority had failed to study the subject from this angle."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"by sober reasoning. This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"and consistent. It is not highly differentiated, but has only the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"negative and positive notions of love and hatred, right and wrong, truth"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"and falsehood. Its notions are never partly this and partly that."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"English propaganda especially understood this in a marvellous way and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"put what they understood into practice. They allowed no half-measures"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"which might have given rise to some doubt."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Proof of how brilliantly they understood that the feeling of the masses"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is something primitive was shown in their policy of publishing tales of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"horror and outrages which fitted in with the real horrors of the time,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"thereby cleverly and ruthlessly preparing the ground for moral"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"solidarity at the front, even in times of great defeats. Further, the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"way in which they pilloried the German enemy as solely responsible for"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the war--which was a brutal and absolute falsehood--and the way in which"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"they proclaimed his guilt was excellently calculated to reach the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"masses, realizing that these are always extremist in their feelings. And"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"thus it was that this atrocious lie was positively believed."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The effectiveness of this kind of propaganda is well illustrated by the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"fact that after four-and-a-half years, not only was the enemy still"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"carrying on his propagandist work, but it was already undermining the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"stamina of our people at home."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"That our propaganda did not achieve similar results is not to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"wondered at, because it had the germs of inefficiency lodged in its very"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"being by reason of its ambiguity. And because of the very nature of its"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"content one could not expect it to make the necessary impression on the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"masses. Only our feckless 'statesmen' could have imagined that on"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"pacifists slops of such a kind the enthusiasm could be nourished which"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is necessary to enkindle that spirit which leads men to die for their"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"country."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"And so this product of ours was not only worthless but detrimental."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"No matter what an amount of talent employed in the organization of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"propaganda, it will have no result if due account is not taken of these"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"fundamental principles. Propaganda must be limited to a few simple"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"themes and these must be represented again and again. Here, as in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"innumerable other cases, perseverance is the first and most important"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"condition of success."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Particularly in the field of propaganda, placid aesthetes and blase"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"intellectuals should never be allowed to take the lead. The former would"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"readily transform the impressive character of real propaganda into"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"something suitable only for literary tea parties. As to the second class"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"of people, one must always beware of this pest; for, in consequence of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"their insensibility to normal impressions, they are constantly seeking"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"new excitements."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Such people grow sick and tired of everything. They always long for"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"change and will always be incapable of putting themselves in the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"position of picturing the wants of their less callous fellow-creatures"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"in their immediate neighbourhood, let alone trying to understand them."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The blase intellectuals are always the first to criticize propaganda, or"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"rather its message, because this appears to them to be outmoded and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"trivial. They are always looking for something new, always yearning for"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"change; and thus they become the mortal enemies of every effort that may"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"be made to influence the masses in an effective way. The moment the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"organization and message of a propagandist movement begins to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"orientated according to their tastes it becomes incoherent and"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"scattered."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"It is not the purpose of propaganda to create a series of alterations in"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"sentiment with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the crowd."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Every change that is made in the subject of a propagandist message must"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"always emphasize the same conclusion. The leading slogan must of course"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end one"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"must always return to the assertion of the same formula. In this way"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"one will be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"that such a persistent policy secures."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or political"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"employed."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"In this respect also the propaganda organized by our enemies set us an"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"excellent example. It confined itself to a few themes, which were meant"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"exclusively for mass consumption, and it repeated these themes with"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"untiring perseverance. Once these fundamental themes and the manner of"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"placing them before the world were recognized as effective, they adhered"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"to them without the slightest alteration for the whole duration of the"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"War. At first all of it appeared to be idiotic in its impudent"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"assertiveness. Later on it was looked upon as disturbing, but finally it"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"was believed."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"But in England they came to understand something further: namely, that"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"the possibility of success in the use of this spiritual weapon consists"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"in the mass employment of it, and that when employed in this way it"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"brings full returns for the large expenses incurred."	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"In England propaganda was regarded as a weapon of the first order,"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"
"whereas with us it represented the last hope of a livelihood for our"	"CHAPTER VII  THE REVOLUTION"

"In 1915 the enemy started his propaganda among our soldiers. From 1916"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"onwards it steadily became more intensive, and at the beginning of 1918"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"it had swollen into a storm flood. One could now judge the effects of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"this proselytizing movement step by step. Gradually our soldiers began"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to think just in the way the enemy wished them to think. On the German"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"side there was no counter-propaganda."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At that time the army authorities, under our able and resolute"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Commander, were willing and ready to take up the fight in the propaganda"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"domain also, but unfortunately they did not have the necessary means to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"carry that intention into effect. Moreover, the army authorities would"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"have made a psychological mistake had they undertaken this task of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"mental training. To be efficacious it had come from the home front. For"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"only thus could it be successful among men who for nearly four years now"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had been performing immortal deeds of heroism and undergoing all sorts"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of privations for the sake of that home. But what were the people at"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"home doing? Was their failure to act merely due to unintelligence or bad"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"faith?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the midsummer of 1918, after the evacuation of the southern bank of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the hearne, the German Press adopted a policy which was so woefully"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"inopportune, and even criminally stupid, that I used to ask myself a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"question which made me more and more furious day after day: Is it really"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"true that we have nobody who will dare to put an end to this process of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"spiritual sabotage which is being carried on among our heroic troops?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"What happened in France during those days of 1914, when our armies"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"invaded that country and were marching in triumph from one victory to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"another? What happened in Italy when their armies collapsed on the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Isonzo front? What happened in France again during the spring of 1918,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"when German divisions took the main French positions by storm and heavy"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"long-distance artillery bombarded Paris?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"How they whipped up the flagging courage of those troops who were"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"retreating and fanned the fires of national enthusiasm among them! How"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"their propaganda and their marvellous aptitude in the exercise of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"mass-influence reawakened the fighting spirit in that broken front and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hammered into the heads of the soldiers a, firm belief in final victory!"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Meanwhile, what were our people doing in this sphere? Nothing, or even"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"worse than nothing. Again and again I used to become enraged and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"indignant as I read the latest papers and realized the nature of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"mass-murder they were committing: through their influence on the minds"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of the people and the soldiers. More than once I was tormented by the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"thought that if Providence had put the conduct of German propaganda into"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"my hands, instead of into the hands of those incompetent and even"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"criminal ignoramuses and weaklings, the outcome of the struggle might"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"have been different."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"During those months I felt for the first time that Fate was dealing"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"adversely with me in keeping me on the fighting front and in a position"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"where any chance bullet from some nigger or other might finish me,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"whereas I could have done the Fatherland a real service in another"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"sphere. For I was then presumptuous enough to believe that I would have"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"been successful in managing the propaganda business."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"But I was a being without a name, one among eight millions. Hence it was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"better for me to keep my mouth shut and do my duty as well as I could in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the position to which I had been assigned."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the summer of 1915 the first enemy leaflets were dropped on our"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"trenches. They all told more or less the same story, with some"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"variations in the form of it. The story was that distress was steadily"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"on the increase in Germany; that the War would last indefinitely; that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the prospect of victory for us was becoming fainter day after day; that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the people at home were yearning for peace, but that 'Militarism' and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the 'Kaiser' would not permit it; that the world--which knew this very"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"well--was not waging war against the German people but only against the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"man who was exclusively responsible, the Kaiser; that until this enemy"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of world-peace was removed there could be no end to the conflict; but"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that when the War was over the liberal and democratic nations would"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"receive the Germans as colleagues in the League for World Peace. This"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"would be done the moment 'Prussian Militarism' had been finally"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"destroyed."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"To illustrate and substantiate all these statements, the leaflets very"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"often contained 'Letters from Home', the contents of which appeared to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"confirm the enemy's propagandist message."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Generally speaking, we only laughed at all these efforts. The leaflets"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"were read, sent to base headquarters, then forgotten until a favourable"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"wind once again blew a fresh contingent into the trenches. These were"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"mostly dropped from aeroplanes which were used specially for that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"purpose."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"One feature of this propaganda was very striking. It was that in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"sections where Bavarian troops were stationed every effort was made by"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the enemy propagandists to stir up feeling against the Prussians,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"assuring the soldiers that Prussia and Prussia alone was the guilty"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"party who was responsible for bringing on and continuing the War, and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that there was no hostility whatsoever towards the Bavarians; but that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"there could be no possibility of coming to their assistance so long as"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"they continued to serve Prussian interests and helped to pull the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Prussian chestnuts out of the fire."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"This persistent propaganda began to have a real influence on our"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"soldiers in 1915. The feeling against Prussia grew quite noticeable"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"among the Bavarian troops, but those in authority did nothing to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"counteract it. This was something more than a mere crime of omission;"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"for sooner or later not only the Prussians were bound to have to atone"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"severely for it but the whole German nation and consequently the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Bavarians themselves also."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In this direction the enemy propaganda began to achieve undoubted"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"success from 1916 onwards."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In a similar way letters coming directly from home had long since been"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"exercising their effect. There was now no further necessity for the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"enemy to broadcast such letters in leaflet form. And also against this"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"influence from home nothing was done except a few supremely stupid"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"'warnings' uttered by the executive government. The whole front was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"drenched in this poison which thoughtless women at home sent out,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"without suspecting for a moment that the enemy's chances of final"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"victory were thus strengthened or that the sufferings of their own men"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"at the front were thus being prolonged and rendered more severe. These"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"stupid letters written by German women eventually cost the lives of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hundreds of thousands of our men."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Thus in 1916 several distressing phenomena were already manifest. The"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"whole front was complaining and grousing, discontented over many things"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"and often justifiably so. While they were hungry and yet patient, and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"their relatives at home were in distress, in other quarters there was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"feasting and revelry. Yes; even on the front itself everything was not"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"as it ought to have been in this regard."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Even in the early stages of the war the soldiers were sometimes prone to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"complain; but such criticism was confined to 'internal affairs'. The man"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"who at one moment groused and grumbled ceased his murmur after a few"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"moments and went about his duty silently, as if everything were in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"order. The company which had given signs of discontent a moment earlier"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hung on now to its bit of trench, defending it tooth and nail, as if"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Germany's fate depended on these few hundred yards of mud and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"shell-holes. The glorious old army was still at its post. A sudden"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"change in my own fortunes soon placed me in a position where I had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"first-hand experience of the contrast between this old army and the home"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"front. At the end of September 1916 my division was sent into the Battle"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of the Somme. For us this was the first of a series of heavy"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"engagements, and the impression created was that of a veritable inferno,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"rather than war. Through weeks of incessant artillery bombardment we"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"stood firm, at times ceding a little ground but then taking it back"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"again, and never giving way. On October 7th, 1916, I was wounded but had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the luck of being able to get back to our lines and was then ordered to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"be sent by ambulance train to Germany."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"such circumstances. I could hardly imagine what Germans looked like"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"without uniforms. In the clearing hospital at Hermies I was startled"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"when I suddenly heard the voice of a German woman who was acting as"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"nursing sister and talking with one of the wounded men lying near me."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Two years! And then this voice for the first time!"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The nearer our ambulance train approached the German frontier the more"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"restless each one of us became. En route we recognised all these places"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"through which we passed two years before as young volunteers--Brussels,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Louvain, Liège--and finally we thought we recognized the first German"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"homestead, with its familiar high gables and picturesque"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"window-shutters. Home!"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"What a change! From the mud of the Somme battlefields to the spotless"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"white beds in this wonderful building. One hesitated at first before"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"entering them. It was only by slow stages that one could grow accustomed"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to this new world again. But unfortunately there were certain other"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"aspects also in which this new world was different."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The spirit of the army at the front appeared to be out of place here."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"For the first time I encountered something which up to then was unknown"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"at the front: namely, boasting of one's own cowardice. For, though we"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"certainly heard complaining and grousing at the front, this was never in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the spirit of any agitation to insubordination and certainly not an"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"attempt to glorify one's fear. No; there at the front a coward was a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"coward and nothing else, And the contempt which his weakness aroused in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the others was quite general, just as the real hero was admired all"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"round. But here in hospital the spirit was quite different in some"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"respects. Loudmouthed agitators were busy here in heaping ridicule on"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the good soldier and painting the weak-kneed poltroon in glorious"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"colours. A couple of miserable human specimens were the ringleaders in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"this process of defamation. One of them boasted of having intentionally"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"injured his hand in barbed-wire entanglements in order to get sent to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hospital. Although his wound was only a slight one, it appeared that he"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had been here for a very long time and would be here interminably. Some"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"arrangement for him seemed to be worked by some sort of swindle, just as"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"he got sent here in the ambulance train through a swindle. This"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"pestilential specimen actually had the audacity to parade his knavery as"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the manifestation of a courage which was superior to that of the brave"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"soldier who dies a hero's death. There were many who heard this talk in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"silence; but there were others who expressed their assent to what the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"fellow said."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Personally I was disgusted at the thought that a seditious agitator of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"this kind should be allowed to remain in such an institution. What could"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"be done? The hospital authorities here must have known who and what he"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"was; and actually they did know. But still they did nothing about it."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"As soon as I was able to walk once again I obtained leave to visit"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Berlin."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Bitter want was in evidence everywhere. The metropolis, with its teeming"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"millions, was suffering from hunger. The talk that was current in the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"various places of refreshment and hospices visited by the soldiers was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"much the same as that in our hospital. The impression given was that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"these agitators purposely singled out such places in order to spread"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"their views."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"But in Munich conditions were far worse. After my discharge from"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hospital, I was sent to a reserve battalion there. I felt as in some"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"strange town. Anger, discontent, complaints met one's ears wherever one"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"went. To a certain extent this was due to the infinitely maladroit"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"manner in which the soldiers who had returned from the front were"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"treated by the non-commissioned officers who had never seen a day's"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"active service and who on that account were partly incapable of adopting"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the proper attitude towards the old soldiers. Naturally those old"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"soldiers displayed certain characteristics which had been developed from"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the experiences in the trenches. The officers of the reserve units could"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"not understand these peculiarities, whereas the officer home from active"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"service was at least in a position to understand them for himself. As a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"result he received more respect from the men than officers at the home"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"headquarters. But, apart from all this, the general spirit was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"deplorable. The art of shirking was looked upon as almost a proof of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"higher intelligence, and devotion to duty was considered a sign of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"weakness or bigotry. Government offices were staffed by Jews. Almost"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"every clerk was a Jew and every Jew was a clerk. I was amazed at this"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"multitude of combatants who belonged to the chosen people and could not"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"help comparing it with their slender numbers in the fighting lines."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the business world the situation was even worse. Here the Jews had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"actually become 'indispensable'. Like leeches, they were slowly sucking"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the blood from the pores of the national body. By means of newly floated"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"War Companies an instrument had been discovered whereby all national"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"trade was throttled so that no business could be carried on freely"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Special emphasis was laid on the necessity for unhampered"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"centralization. Hence as early as 1916-17 practically all production was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"under the control of Jewish finance."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"But against whom was the anger of the people directed? It was then that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I already saw the fateful day approaching which must finally bring the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"DEBACLE, unless timely preventive measures were taken."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"While Jewry was busy despoiling the nation and tightening the screws of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"its despotism, the work of inciting the people against the Prussians"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"increased. And just as nothing was done at the front to put a stop to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the venomous propaganda, so here at home no official steps were taken"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"against it. Nobody seemed capable of understanding that the collapse of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Prussia could never bring about the rise of Bavaria. On the contrary,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the collapse of the one must necessarily drag the other down with it."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"This kind of behaviour affected me very deeply. In it I could see only a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"clever Jewish trick for diverting public attention from themselves to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"others. While Prussians and Bavarians were squabbling, the Jews were"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"taking away the sustenance of both from under their very noses. While"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Prussians were being abused in Bavaria the Jews organized the revolution"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"and with one stroke smashed both Prussia and Bavaria."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I could not tolerate this execrable squabbling among people of the same"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"German stock and preferred to be at the front once again. Therefore,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"just after my arrival in Munich I reported myself for service again. At"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the beginning of March 1917 I rejoined my old regiment at the front."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Towards the end of 1917 it seemed as if we had got over the worst phases"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of moral depression at the front. After the Russian collapse the whole"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"army recovered its courage and hope, and all were gradually becoming"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"more and more convinced that the struggle would end in our favour. We"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"could sing once again. The ravens were ceasing to croak. Faith in the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"future of the Fatherland was once more in the ascendant."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The Italian collapse in the autumn of 1917 had a wonderful effect; for"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"this victory proved that it was possible to break through another front"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"besides the Russian. This inspiring thought now became dominant in the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"minds of millions at the front and encouraged them to look forward with"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"confidence to the spring of 1918. It was quite obvious that the enemy"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"was in a state of depression. During this winter the front was somewhat"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"quieter than usual. But that was the calm before the storm."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Just when preparations were being made to launch a final offensive which"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"would bring this seemingly eternal struggle to an end, while endless"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"columns of transports were bringing men and munitions to the front, and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"while the men were being trained for that final onslaught, then it was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that the greatest act of treachery during the whole War was accomplished"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"in Germany."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Germany must not win the War. At that moment when victory seemed ready"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to alight on the German standards, a conspiracy was arranged for the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"purpose of striking at the heart of the German spring offensive with one"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"blow from the rear and thus making victory impossible. A general strike"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"in the munition factories was organized."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"If this conspiracy could achieve its purpose the German front would have"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"collapsed and the wishes of the VORWÄRTS (the organ of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Social-Democratic Party) that this time victory should not take the side"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of the German banners, would have been fulfilled. For want of munitions"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the front would be broken through within a few weeks, the offensive"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"would be effectively stopped and the Entente saved. Then International"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Finance would assume control over Germany and the internal objective of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the Marxist national betrayal would be achieved. That objective was the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"destruction of the national economic system and the establishment of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"international capitalistic domination in its stead. And this goal has"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"really been reached, thanks to the stupid credulity of the one side and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the unspeakable treachery of the other."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The munition strike, however, did not bring the final success that had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"been hoped for: namely, to starve the front of ammunition. It lasted too"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"short a time for the lack of ammunitions as such to bring disaster to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the army, as was originally planned. But the moral damage was much more"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"terrible."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the first place. what was the army fighting for if the people at home"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"did not wish it to be victorious? For whom then were these enormous"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"sacrifices and privations being made and endured? Must the soldiers"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"fight for victory while the home front goes on strike against it?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the second place, what effect did this move have on the enemy?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the winter of 1917-18 dark clouds hovered in the firmament of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Entente. For nearly four years onslaught after onslaught has been made"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"against the German giant, but they failed to bring him to the ground. He"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had to keep them at bay with one arm that held the defensive shield"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"because his other arm had to be free to wield the sword against his"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"enemies, now in the East and now in the South. But at last these enemies"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"were overcome and his rear was now free for the conflict in the West."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Rivers of blood had been shed for the accomplishment of that task; but"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"now the sword was free to combine in battle with the shield on the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Western Front. And since the enemy had hitherto failed to break the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"German defence here, the Germans themselves had now to launch the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"attack. The enemy feared and trembled before the prospect of this German"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"victory."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At Paris and London conferences followed one another in unending series."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Even the enemy propaganda encountered difficulties. It was no longer so"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"German military authorities by the necessities of the situation, now"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"seemed to the Entente as a tactical stroke of genius. For three years"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"triumph through sheer force of numbers. Germany would be worn out"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"through shedding so much blood. And facts appeared to confirm this hope."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"had sacrificed the most blood on the altar of their mutual interests had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"come to the end of his resources and lay prostrate before his"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"awaited in fear and trembling, suddenly a lurid light was set aglow in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Germany and sent its rays into the last shell-hole on the enemy's front."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At the very moment when the German divisions were receiving their final"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"orders for the great offensive a general strike broke out in Germany."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At first the world was dumbfounded. Then the enemy propaganda began"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"activities once again and pounced on this theme at the eleventh hour."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"All of a sudden a means had come which could be utilized to revive the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"could now be presented as certain, and the anxious foreboding in regard"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"German onslaught in history could now be inspired with the conviction"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that the final decision in this war would not be won by the audacity of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the German assault but rather by the powers of endurance on the side of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the defence. Let the Germans now have whatever victories they liked, the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"revolution and not the victorious army was welcomed in the Fatherland."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"British, French and American newspapers began to spread this belief"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"'Germany Facing Revolution! An Allied Victory Inevitable!' That was the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"best medicine to set the staggering Poilu and Tommy on their feet once"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"again. Our rifles and machine-guns could now open fire once again; but"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"instead of effecting a panic-stricken retreat they were now met with a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"determined resistance that was full of confidence."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"That was the result of the strike in the munitions factories. Throughout"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the enemy countries faith in victory was thus revived and strengthened,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"and that paralysing feeling of despair which had hitherto made itself"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"felt on the Entente front was banished. Consequently the strike cost the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"lives of thousands of German soldiers. But the despicable instigators of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that dastardly strike were candidates for the highest public positions"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"At first it was apparently possible to overcome the repercussion of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"lasting effect. Here the resistance had lost all the character of an"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"army fighting for a lost cause. In its place there was now a grim"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"determination to struggle through to victory. For, according to all"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"human rules of judgment, victory would now be assured if the Western"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"front could hold out against the German offensive even for only a few"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"It was my luck that I was able to take part in the first two offensives"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"and in the final offensive. These have left on me the most stupendous"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"impressions of my life--stupendous, because now for the last time the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"struggle lost its defensive character and assumed the character of an"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"offensive, just as it was in 1914. A sigh of relief went up from the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"German trenches and dug-outs when finally, after three years of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"endurance in that inferno, the day for the settling of accounts had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"come. Once again the lusty cheering of victorious battalions was heard,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"as they hung the last crowns of the immortal laurel on the standards"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"which they consecrated to Victory. Once again the strains of patriotic"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"songs soared upwards to the heavens above the endless columns of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"marching troops, and for the last time the Lord smiled on his ungrateful"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"children."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In the midsummer of 1918 a feeling of sultry oppression hung over the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"front. At home they were quarrelling. About what? We heard a great deal"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"among various units at the front. The War was now a hopeless affair, and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"only the foolhardy could think of victory. It was not the people but the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"capitalists and the Monarchy who were interested in carrying on. Such"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"were the ideas that came from home and were discussed at the front."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At first this gave rise to only very slight reaction. What did universal"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"suffrage matter to us? Is this what we had been fighting for during four"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"years? It was a dastardly piece of robbery thus to filch from the graves"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of our heroes the ideals for which they had fallen. It was not to the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"slogan, 'Long Live Universal Suffrage,' that our troops in Flanders once"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"faced certain death but with the cry, 'DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES IN DER"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"WELT'. A small but by no means an unimportant difference. And the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"majority of those who were shouting for this suffrage were absent when"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"it came to fighting for it. All this political rabble were strangers to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"us at the front. During those days only a fraction of these"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"parliamentarian gentry were to be seen where honest Germans"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"foregathered."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The old soldiers who had fought at the front had little liking for those"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"new war aims of Messrs. Ebert, Scheidemann, Barth, Liebknecht and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"others. We could not understand why, all of a sudden, the shirkers"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"should abrogate all executive powers to themselves, without having any"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"regard to the army."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"From the very beginning I had my own definite personal views. I"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"intensely loathed the whole gang of miserable party politicians who had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"betrayed the people. I had long ago realized that the interests of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"nation played only a very small part with this disreputable crew and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that what counted with them was the possibility of filling their own"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"empty pockets. My opinion was that those people thoroughly deserved to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"be hanged, because they were ready to sacrifice the peace and if"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"necessary allow Germany to be defeated just to serve their own ends. To"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"consider their wishes would mean to sacrifice the interests of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"working classes for the benefit of a gang of thieves. To meet their"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"wishes meant that one should agree to sacrifice Germany."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Such, too, was the opinion still held by the majority of the army. But"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the reinforcements which came from home were fast becoming worse and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"worse; so much so that their arrival was a source of weakness rather"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"than of strength to our fighting forces. The young recruits in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"particular were for the most part useless. Sometimes it was hard to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"believe that they were sons of the same nation that sent its youth into"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the battles that were fought round Ypres."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In August and September the symptoms of moral disintegration increased"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"more and more rapidly, although the enemy's offensive was not at all"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"comparable to the frightfulness of our own former defensive battles. In"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"comparison with this offensive the battles fought on the Somme and in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Flanders remained in our memories as the most terrible of all horrors."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"At the end of September my division occupied, for the third time, those"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"positions which we had once taken by storm as young volunteers. What a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"memory!"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Here we had received our baptism of fire, in October and November 1914."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"With a burning love of the homeland in their hearts and a song on their"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"lips, our young regiment went into action as if going to a dance. The"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"dearest blood was given freely here in the belief that it was shed to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"protect the freedom and independence of the Fatherland."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In July 1917 we set foot for the second time on what we regarded as"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"sacred soil. Were not our best comrades at rest here, some of them"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"little more than boys--the soldiers who had rushed into death for their"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"country's sake, their eyes glowing with enthusiastic love."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The older ones among us, who had been with the regiment from the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"beginning, were deeply moved as we stood on this sacred spot where we"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had sworn 'Loyalty and Duty unto Death'. Three years ago the regiment"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had taken this position by storm; now it was called upon to defend it in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"a gruelling struggle."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"With an artillery bombardment that lasted three weeks the English"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"prepared for their great offensive in Flanders. There the spirits of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"dead seemed to live again. The regiment dug itself into the mud, clung"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to its shell-holes and craters, neither flinching nor wavering, but"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"growing smaller in numbers day after day. Finally the British launched"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"their attack on July 31st, 1917."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"We were relieved in the beginning of August. The regiment had dwindled"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"down to a few companies, who staggered back, mud-crusted, more like"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"phantoms than human beings. Besides a few hundred yards of shell-holes,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"death was the only reward which the English gained."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Now in the autumn of 1918 we stood for the third time on the ground we"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"had stormed in 1914. The village of Comines, which formerly had served"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"us as a base, was now within the fighting zone. Although little had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"changed in the surrounding district itself, yet the men had become"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"different, somehow or other. They now talked politics. Like everywhere"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"else, the poison from home was having its effect here also. The young"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"drafts succumbed to it completely. They had come directly from home."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"During the night of October 13th-14th, the British opened an attack with"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"gas on the front south of Ypres. They used the yellow gas whose effect"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"was unknown to us, at least from personal experience. I was destined to"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"experience it that very night. On a hill south of Werwick, in the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"evening of October 13th, we were subjected for several hours to a heavy"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"bombardment with gas bombs, which continued throughout the night with"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"more or less intensity. About midnight a number of us were put out of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"action, some for ever. Towards morning I also began to feel pain. It"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"increased with every quarter of an hour; and about seven o'clock my eyes"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"were scorching as I staggered back and delivered the last dispatch I was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"destined to carry in this war. A few hours later my eyes were like"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"glowing coals and all was darkness around me."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I was sent into hospital at Pasewalk in Pomerania, and there it was that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I had to hear of the Revolution."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"For a long time there had been something in the air which was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"indefinable and repulsive. People were saying that something was bound"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to happen within the next few weeks, although I could not imagine what"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"this meant. In the first instance I thought of a strike similar to the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"one which had taken place in spring. Unfavourable rumours were"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"constantly coming from the Navy, which was said to be in a state of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"ferment. But this seemed to be a fanciful creation of a few isolated"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"young people. It is true that at the hospital they were all talking abut"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the end of the war and hoping that this was not far off, but nobody"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"thought that the decision would come immediately. I was not able to read"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the newspapers."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"In November the general tension increased. Then one day disaster broke"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"in upon us suddenly and without warning. Sailors came in motor-lorries"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"and called on us to rise in revolt. A few Jew-boys were the leaders in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that combat for the 'Liberty, Beauty, and Dignity' of our National"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Being. Not one of them had seen active service at the front. Through the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"medium of a hospital for venereal diseases these three Orientals had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"been sent back home. Now their red rags were being hoisted here."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"During the last few days I had begun to feel somewhat better. The"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"burning pain in the eye-sockets had become less severe. Gradually I was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"able to distinguish the general outlines of my immediate surroundings."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"And it was permissible to hope that at least I would recover my sight"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"sufficiently to be able to take up some profession later on. That I"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"would ever be able to draw or design once again was naturally out of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"question. Thus I was on the way to recovery when the frightful hour"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"came."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"My first thought was that this outbreak of high treason was only a local"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"affair. I tried to enforce this belief among my comrades. My Bavarian"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"hospital mates, in particular, were readily responsive. Their"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"inclinations were anything but revolutionary. I could not imagine this"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"madness breaking out in Munich; for it seemed to me that loyalty to the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"House of Wittelsbach was, after all, stronger than the will of a few"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Jews. And so I could not help believing that this was merely a revolt in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the Navy and that it would be suppressed within the next few days."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"With the next few days came the most astounding information of my life."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"The rumours grew more and more persistent. I was told that what I had"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"considered to be a local affair was in reality a general revolution. In"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"addition to this, from the front came the shameful news that they wished"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to capitulate! What! Was such a thing possible?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"On November 10th the local pastor visited the hospital for the purpose"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of delivering a short address. And that was how we came to know the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"whole story."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I was in a fever of excitement as I listened to the address. The"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"reverend old gentleman seemed to be trembling when he informed us that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the House of Hohen-zollern should no longer wear the Imperial Crown,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that the Fatherland had become a 'Republic', that we should pray to the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Almighty not to withhold His blessing from the new order of things and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"not to abandon our people in the days to come. In delivering this"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"message he could not do more than briefly express appreciation of the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Royal House, its services to Pomerania, to Prussia, indeed, to the whole"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of the German Fatherland, and--here he began to weep. A feeling of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"profound dismay fell on the people in that assembly, and I do not think"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"there was a single eye that withheld its tears. As for myself, I broke"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"down completely when the old gentleman tried to resume his story by"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"informing us that we must now end this long war, because the war was"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"lost, he said, and we were at the mercy of the victor. The Fatherland"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"would have to bear heavy burdens in the future. We were to accept the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"terms of the Armistice and trust to the magnanimity of our former"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"enemies. It was impossible for me to stay and listen any longer."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Darkness surrounded me as I staggered and stumbled back to my ward and"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"buried my aching head between the blankets and pillow."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"I had not cried since the day that I stood beside my mother's grave."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Whenever Fate dealt cruelly with me in my young days the spirit of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"determination within me grew stronger and stronger. During all those"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"long years of war, when Death claimed many a true friend and comrade"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"from our ranks, to me it would have appeared sinful to have uttered a"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"word of complaint. Did they not die for Germany? And, finally, almost in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the last few days of that titanic struggle, when the waves of poison gas"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"enveloped me and began to penetrate my eyes, the thought of becoming"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"permanently blind unnerved me; but the voice of conscience cried out"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"immediately: Poor miserable fellow, will you start howling when there"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"are thousands of others whose lot is a hundred times worse than yours?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"And so I accepted my misfortune in silence, realizing that this was the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"only thing to be done and that personal suffering was nothing when"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"compared with the misfortune of one's country."	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"So all had been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and privations, in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"vain the hunger and thirst for endless months, in vain those hours that"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"we stuck to our posts though the fear of death gripped our souls, and in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"vain the deaths of two millions who fell in discharging this duty. Think"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of those hundreds of thousands who set out with hearts full of faith in"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"their fatherland, and never returned; ought not their graves to open, so"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that the spirits of those heroes bespattered with mud and blood should"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"come home and take vengeance on those who had so despicably betrayed the"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"greatest sacrifice which a human being can make for his country? Was it"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"for this that the soldiers died in August and September 1914, for this"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"that the volunteer regiments followed the old comrades in the autumn of"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"the same year? Was it for this that those boys of seventeen years of age"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"were mingled with the earth of Flanders? Was this meant to be the fruits"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"of the sacrifice which German mothers made for their Fatherland when,"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"with heavy hearts, they said good-bye to their sons who never returned?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Has all this been done in order to enable a gang of despicable criminals"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"to lay hands on the Fatherland?"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"
"Was this then what the German soldier struggled for through sweltering"	"CHAPTER VIII THE BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITIES"

"The situation there could not last as it was. It tended irresistibly to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"a further extension of the Revolution. Eisner's death served only to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"had contrived the Revolution."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"every project had to give way before the hard fact that I was quite"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"After another few weeks I received orders to attend a course of lectures"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"which were being given to members of the army. This course was meant to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"inculcate certain fundamental principles on which the soldier could base"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"imminent disaster by those who had participated in the November"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"that the so-called Bourgeois-National group could not make good the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"damage that had been done, even if they had the best intentions. They"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"lacked a number of requisites without which such a task could never be"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"successfully undertaken. The years that followed have justified the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"opinions which we held at that time."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"In our small circle we discussed the project of forming a new party. The"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"leading ideas which we then proposed were the same as those which were"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"carried into effect afterwards, when the German Labour Party was"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"founded. The name of the new movement which was to be founded should be"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"such that of itself, it would appeal to the mass of the people; for all"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"our efforts would turn out vain and useless if this condition were"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"lacking. And that was the reason why we chose the name"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"'Social-Revolutionary Party', particularly because the social principles"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"of our new organization were indeed revolutionary."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"But there was also a more fundamental reason. The attention which I had"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"given to economic problems during my earlier years was more or less"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"confined to considerations arising directly out of the social problem."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"Subsequently this outlook broadened as I came to study the German policy"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"of the Triple Alliance. This policy was very largely the result of an"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"erroneous valuation of the economic situation, together with a confused"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"notion as to the basis on which the future subsistence of the German"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"people could be guaranteed. All these ideas were based on the principle"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"that capital is exclusively the product of labour and that, just like"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"labour, it was subject to all the factors which can hinder or promote"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"human activity. Hence, from the national standpoint, the significance of"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"capital depended on the greatness and freedom and power of the State,"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"that is to say, of the nation, and that it is this dependence alone"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"which leads capital to promote the interests of the State and the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"nation, from the instinct of self-preservation and for the sake of its"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"own development."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"On such principles the attitude of the State towards capital would be"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"comparatively simple and clear. Its only object would be to make sure"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"that capital remained subservient to the State and did not allocate to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"itself the right to dominate national interests. Thus it could confine"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"its activities within the two following limits: on the one side, to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"assure a vital and independent system of national economy and, on the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"other, to safeguard the social rights of the workers."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"Previously I did not recognize with adequate clearness the difference"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"between capital which is purely the product of creative labour and the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"existence and nature of capital which is exclusively the result of"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"financial speculation. Here I needed an impulse to set my mind thinking"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"in this direction; but that impulse had hitherto been lacking."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"The requisite impulse now came from one of the men who delivered"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"lectures in the course I have already mentioned. This was Gottfried"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"Feder."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"For the first time in my life I heard a discussion which dealt with the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"principles of stock-exchange capital and capital which was used for loan"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"activities. After hearing the first lecture delivered by Feder, the idea"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"immediately came into my head that I had now found a way to one of the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"most essential pre-requisites for the founding of a new party."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"To my mind, Feder's merit consisted in the ruthless and trenchant way in"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"which he described the double character of the capital engaged in"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"stock-exchange and loan transaction, laying bare the fact that this"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"capital is ever and always dependent on the payment of interest. In"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"fundamental questions his statements were so full of common sense that"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"those who criticized him did not deny that AU FOND his ideas were sound"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"but they doubted whether it be possible to put these ideas into"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"practice. To me this seemed the strongest point in Feder's teaching,"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"though others considered it a weak point."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"It is not the business of him who lays down a theoretical programme to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"explain the various ways in which something can be put into practice."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"His task is to deal with the problem as such; and, therefore, he has to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"look to the end rather than the means. The important question is whether"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"an idea is fundamentally right or not. The question of whether or not it"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"may be difficult to carry it out in practice is quite another matter."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"When a man whose task it is to lay down the principles of a programme or"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"policy begins to busy himself with the question as to whether it is"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"expedient and practical, instead of confining himself to the statement"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"of the absolute truth, his work will cease to be a guiding star to those"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"who are looking about for light and leading and will become merely a"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"recipe for every-day iife. The man who lays down the programme of a"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"movement must consider only the goal. It is for the political leader to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"point out the way in which that goal may be reached. The thought of the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"former will, therefore, be determined by those truths that are"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"everlasting, whereas the activity of the latter must always be guided by"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"taking practical account of the circumstances under which those truths"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"have to be carried into effect."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"The greatness of the one will depend on the absolute truth of his idea,"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"considered in the abstract; whereas that of the other will depend on"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"whether or not he correctly judges the given realities and how they may"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"be utilized under the guidance of the truths established by the former."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"The test of greatness as applied to a political leader is the success of"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"his plans and his enterprises, which means his ability to reach the goal"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"for which he sets out; whereas the final goal set up by the political"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"philosopher can never be reached; for human thought may grasp truths and"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"picture ends which it sees like clear crystal, though such ends can"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"never be completely fulfilled because human nature is weak and"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"imperfect. The more an idea is correct in the abstract, and, therefore,"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"all the more powerful, the smaller is the possibility of putting it into"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"practice, at least as far as this latter depends on human beings. The"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"significance of a political philosopher does not depend on the practical"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"success of the plans he lays down but rather on their absolute truth and"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"the influence they exert on the progress of mankind. If it were"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"otherwise, the founders of religions could not be considered as the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"greatest men who have ever lived, because their moral aims will never be"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"completely or even approximately carried out in practice. Even that"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"religion which is called the Religion of Love is really no more than a"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"faint reflex of the will of its sublime Founder. But its significance"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"lies in the orientation which it endeavoured to give to human"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"civilization, and human virtue and morals."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"This very wide difference between the functions of a political"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"philosopher and a practical political leader is the reason why the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"qualifications necessary for both functions are scarcely ever found"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"associated in the same person. This applies especially to the so-called"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"successful politician of the smaller kind, whose activity is indeed"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"hardly more than practising the art of doing the possible, as Bismarck"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"modestly defined the art of politics in general. If such a politician"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"resolutely avoids great ideas his success will be all the easier to"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"attain; it will be attained more expeditely and frequently will be more"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"tangible. By reason of this very fact, however, such success is doomed"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"to futility and sometimes does not even survive the death of its author."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"Generally speaking, the work of politicians is without significance for"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"the following generation, because their temporary success was based on"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"the expediency of avoiding all really great decisive problems and ideas"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"which would be valid also for future generations."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"To pursue ideals which will still be of value and significance for the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"future is generally not a very profitable undertaking and he who follows"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"Because of a certain vanity, which is always one of the blood-relations"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"they are quite content with momentary results."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"The position of the constructive political philosopher is quite"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"standpoint of the future; and he is frequently described by the word"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"WELTFREMD, or dreamer. While the ability of the politician consists in"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"mastering the art of the possible, the founder of a political system"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"belongs to those who are said to please the gods only because they wish"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"felt it his duty to make retroactive atonement for the wrong which great"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"internationalization in German business without at the same time"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"attacking capital as such, for to do this would jeopardize the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"developing in Germany and I realized then that the stiffest fight we"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"would have to wage would not be against the enemy nations but against"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"In the second place, the following must be borne in mind: Any idea may"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"fulfil the mission assigned to it by the Creator."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"ends. It is from this standpoint that everything must be examined and"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"turned to practical uses or else discarded. Thus a theory can never"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"become a mere dead dogma since everything will have to serve the"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"days later, I was assigned to a regiment then stationed at Munich and"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"given a position there as 'instruction officer'."	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"At that time the spirit of discipline was rather weak among those"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"I was now able to confirm what I had hitherto merely felt, namely, that"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"I had a talent for public speaking. My voice had become so much better"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"
"that I could be well understood, at least in all parts of the small hall"	"CHAPTER IX   THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY"

"German Labour Party' and was soon to hold a meeting at which Gottfried"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Feder would speak. I was ordered to attend this meeting and report on"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the situation."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The spirit of curiosity in which the army authorities then regarded"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"political parties can be very well understood. The Revolution had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"granted the soldiers the right to take an active part in politics and it"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"was particularly those with the smallest experience who had availed"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"themselves of this right. But not until the Centre and the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Social-Democratic parties were reluctantly forced to recognize that the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"sympathies of the soldiers had turned away from the revolutionary"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"

"they feel obliged to withdraw from the army the right to vote and to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"forbid it all political activity."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The fact that the Centre and Marxism had adopted this policy was"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"instructive, because if they had not thus curtailed the 'rights of the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"citizen'--as they described the political rights of the soldiers after"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the Revolution--the government which had been established in November"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"1918 would have been overthrown within a few years and the dishonour and"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"disgrace of the nation would not have been further prolonged. At that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"time the soldiers were on the point of taking the best way to rid the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"nation of the vampires and valets who served the cause of the Entente in"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the interior of the country. But the fact that the so-called 'national'"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"parties voted enthusiastically for the doctrinaire policy of the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"criminals who organized the Revolution in November (1918) helped also to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"render the army ineffective as an instrument of national restoration and"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"thus showed once again where men might be led by the purely abstract"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"notions accepted by these most gullible people."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The minds of the bourgeois middle classes had become so fossilized that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"they sincerely believed the army could once again become what it had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"previously been, namely, a rampart of German valour; while the Centre"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"

"nationalism, without which an army must always remain just a police"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"force but can never be in the position of a military organization"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"capable of fighting against the outside enemy. This truth was"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"sufficiently proved by subsequent events."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Or did our 'national' politicians believe, after all, that the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"development of our army could be other than national? This belief might"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"be possible and could be explained by the fact that during the War they"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"were not soldiers but merely talkers. In other words, they were"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"parliamentarians, and, as such, they did not have the slightest idea of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"what was passing in the hearts of those men who remembered the greatness"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"of their own past and also remembered that they had once been the first"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"soldiers in the world."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I decided to attend the meeting of this Party, which had hitherto been"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"entirely unknown to me. When I arrived that evening in the guest room of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the former Sternecker Brewery--which has now become a place of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"historical significance for us--I found approximately 20-25 persons"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"present, most of them belonging to the lower classes."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The theme of Feder's lecture was already familiar to me; for I had heard"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"it in the lecture course I have spoken of. Therefore, I could"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"concentrate my attention on studying the society itself."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The impression it made upon me was neither good nor bad. I felt that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"here was just another one of these many new societies which were being"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"formed at that time. In those days everybody felt called upon to found a"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"new Party whenever he felt displeased with the course of events and had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"lost confidence in all the parties already existing. Thus it was that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"new associations sprouted up all round, to disappear just as quickly,"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"without exercising any effect or making any noise whatsoever. Generally"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"speaking, the founders of such associations did not have the slightest"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"idea of what it means to bring together a number of people for the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"foundations of a party or a movement. Therefore these associations"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"disappeared because of their woeful lack of anything like an adequate"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"grasp of the necessities of the situation."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"My opinion of the 'German Labour Party' was not very different after I"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"had listened to their proceedings for about two hours. I was glad when"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Feder finally came to a close. I had observed enough and was just about"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"to leave when it was announced that anybody who wished was free to open"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"a discussion. Thereupon, I decided to remain. But the discussion seemed"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"to proceed without anything of vital importance being mentioned, when"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"suddenly a 'professor' commenced to speak. He opened by throwing doubt"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"on the accuracy of what Feder had said, and then. after Feder had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"replied very effectively, the professor suddenly took up his position on"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"what he called 'the basis of facts,' but before this he recommended the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"young party most urgently to introduce the secession of Bavaria from"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Prussia as one of the leading proposals in its programme. In the most"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"self-assured way, this man kept on insisting that German-Austria would"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"join Bavaria and that the peace would then function much better. He made"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"other similarly extravagant statements. At this juncture I felt bound to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"ask for permission to speak and to tell the learned gentleman what I"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"thought. The result was that the honourable gentleman who had last"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"spoken slipped out of his place, like a whipped cur, without uttering a"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"sound. While I was speaking the audience listened with an expression of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"surprise on their faces. When I was just about to say good-night to the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"assembly and to leave, a man came after me quickly and introduced"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"himself. I did not grasp the name correctly; but he placed a little book"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"in my hand, which was obviously a political pamphlet, and asked me very"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"earnestly to read it."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I was quite pleased; because in this way, I could come to know about"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"this association without having to attend its tiresome meetings."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Moreover, this man, who had the appearance of a workman, made a good"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"impression on me. Thereupon, I left the hall."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"At that time I was living in one of the barracks of the 2nd Infantry"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Regiment. I had a little room which still bore the unmistakable traces"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"of the Revolution. During the day I was mostly out, at the quarters of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Light Infantry No. 41 or else attending meetings or lectures, held at"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"some other branch of the army. I spent only the night at the quarters"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"where I lodged. Since I usually woke up about five o'clock every morning"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I got into the habit of amusing myself with watching little mice which"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"played around in my small room. I used to place a few pieces of hard"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"bread or crust on the floor and watch the funny little beasts playing"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"around and enjoying themselves with these delicacies. I had suffered so"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"many privations in my own life that I well knew what hunger was and"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"could only too well picture to myself the pleasure these little"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"creatures were experiencing."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"So on the morning after the meeting I have mentioned, it happened that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"about five o'clock I lay fully awake in bed, watching the mice playing"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"and vying with each other. As I was not able to go to sleep again, I"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"suddenly remembered the pamphlet that one of the workers had given me at"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the meeting. It was a small pamphlet of which this worker was the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"author. In his little book he described how his mind had thrown off the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"shackles of the Marxist and trades-union phraseology, and that he had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"come back to the nationalist ideals. That was the reason why he had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"entitled his little book: My Political Awakening. The pamphlet secured"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"my attention the moment I began to read, and I read it with interest to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the end. The process here described was similar to that which I had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"experienced in my own case ten years previously. Unconsciously my own"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"experiences began to stir again in my mind. During that day my thoughts"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"returned several times to what I had read; but I finally decided to give"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the matter no further attention. A week or so later, however, I received"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"a postcard which informed me, to my astonishment, that I had been"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"admitted into the German Labour Party. I was asked to answer this"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"communication and to attend a meeting of the Party Committee on"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Wednesday next."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"This manner of getting members rather amazed me, and I did not know"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"whether to be angry or laugh at it. Hitherto I had not any idea of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"entering a party already in existence but wanted to found one of my own."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Such an invitation as I now had received I looked upon as entirely out"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"of the question for me."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I was about to send a written reply when my curiosity got the better of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"me, and I decided to attend the gathering at the date assigned, so that"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I might expound my principles to these gentlemen in person."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Wednesday came. The tavern in which the meeting was to take place was"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the 'Alte Rosenbad' in the Herrnstrasse, into which apparently only an"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"occasional guest wandered. This was not very surprising in the year"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"1919, when the bills of fare even at the larger restaurants were only"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"very modest and scanty in their pretensions and thus not very attractive"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"to clients. But I had never before heard of this restaurant."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I went through the badly-lighted guest-room, where not a single guest"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"was to be seen, and searched for the door which led to the side room;"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"and there I was face-to-face with the 'Congress'. Under the dim light"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"shed by a grimy gas-lamp I could see four young people sitting around a"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"table, one of them the author of the pamphlet. He greeted me cordially"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"and welcomed me as a new member of the German Labour Party."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I was taken somewhat aback on being informed that actually the National"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"President of the Party had not yet come; so I decided that I would keep"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"back my own exposition for the time being. Finally the President"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"appeared. He was the man who had been chairman of the meeting held in"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the Sternecker Brewery, when Feder spoke."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"My curiosity was stimulated anew and I sat waiting for what was going to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"happen. Now I got at least as far as learning the names of the gentlemen"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"who had been parties to the whole affair. The REICH National President"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"of the Association was a certain Herr Harrer and the President for the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Munich district was Anton Drexler."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The minutes of the previous meeting were read out and a vote of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"confidence in the secretary was passed. Then came the treasurer's"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"report. The Society possessed a total fund of seven marks and fifty"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"pfennigs (a sum corresponding to 7s. 6d. in English money at par),"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"whereupon the treasurer was assured that he had the confidence of the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"members. This was now inserted in the minutes. Then letters of reply"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"which had been written by the Chairman were read; first, to a letter"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"received from Kiel, then to one from Düsseldorf and finally to one from"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Berlin. All three replies received the approval of all present. Then the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"incoming letters were read--one from Berlin, one from Düsseldorf and one"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"from Kiel. The reception of these letters seemed to cause great"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"satisfaction. This increasing bulk of correspondence was taken as the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"best and most obvious sign of the growing importance of the German"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Labour Party. And then? Well, there followed a long discussion of the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"replies which would be given to these newly-received letters."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"It was all very awful. This was the worst kind of parish-pump clubbism."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"And was I supposed to become a member of such a club?"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"The question of new members was next discussed--that is to say, the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"question of catching myself in the trap."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I now began to ask questions. But I found that, apart from a few general"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"principles, there was nothing--no programme, no pamphlet, nothing at all"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"in print, no card of membership, not even a party stamp, nothing but"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"obvious good faith and good intentions."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I no longer felt inclined to laugh; for what else was all this but a"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"typical sign of the most complete perplexity and deepest despair in"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"regard to all political parties, their programmes and views and"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"activities? The feeling which had induced those few young people to join"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"in what seemed such a ridiculous enterprise was nothing but the call of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the inner voice which told them--though more intuitively than"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"consciously--that the whole party system as it had hitherto existed was"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"not the kind of force that could restore the German nation or repair the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"damages that had been done to the German people by those who hitherto"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"controlled the internal affairs of the nation. I quickly read through"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the list of principles that formed the platform of the party. These"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"principles were stated on typewritten sheets. Here again I found"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"evidence of the spirit of longing and searching, but no sign whatever of"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"a knowledge of the conflict that had to be fought. I myself had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"experienced the feelings which inspired those people. It was the longing"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"for a movement which should be more than a party, in the hitherto"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"accepted meaning of that word."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"When I returned to my room in the barracks that evening I had formed a"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"definite opinion on this association and I was facing the most difficult"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"problem of my life. Should I join this party or refuse?"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"From the side of the intellect alone, every consideration urged me to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"refuse; but my feelings troubled me. The more I tried to prove to myself"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"how senseless this club was, on the whole, the more did my feelings"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"incline me to favour it. During the following days I was restless."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"I began to consider all the pros and cons. I had long ago decided to"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"take an active part in politics. The fact that I could do so only"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"through a new movement was quite clear to me; but I had hitherto lacked"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"the impulse to take concrete action. I am not one of those people who"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"will begin something to-day and just give it up the next day for the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"sake of something new. That was the main reason which made it so"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"difficult for me to decide in joining something newly founded; for this"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"must become the real fulfilment of everything I dreamt, or else it had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"better not be started at all. I knew that such a decision should bind me"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"for ever and that there could be no turning back. For me there could be"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"no idle dallying but only a cause to be championed ardently. I had"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"already an instinctive feeling against people who took up everything,"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"but never carried anything through to the end. I loathed these"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Jacks-of-all-Trades, and considered the activities of such people to be"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"worse than if they were to remain entirely quiescent."	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"Fate herself now seemed to supply the finger-post that pointed out the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"way. I should never have entered one of the big parties already in"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"existence and shall explain my reasons for this later on. This ludicrous"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"little formation, with its handful of members, seemed to have the unique"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"advantage of not yet being fossilized into an 'organization' and still"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"offered a chance for real personal activity on the part of the"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"individual. Here it might still be possible to do some effective work;"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"
"and, as the movement was still small, one could all the easier give it"	"CHAPTER V    THE WORLD WAR"

"not in private dwellings that the characteristic art of ancient cities"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"
"was displayed but in the public monuments, which were not meant to have"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"
"a transitory interest but an enduring one. And this was because they did"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"
"not represent the wealth of some individual citizen but the greatness"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"in the pomp of Rome during the decadence it was not the villas and"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"the dominant feature of these cities even to our own day, although they"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"positive feature was that the supreme rulership of the State was"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"symbol of responsibility, which a monarch has to bear more seriously"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"function among the German people, which made amends for many of its"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"
"defects. The German residential cities have remained, even to our time,"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"
"centres of that artistic spirit which now threatens to disappear and is"	"CHAPTER X    WHY THE SECOND REICH COLLAPSED"

"RACE AND PEOPLE"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"There are certain truths which stand out so openly on the roadsides of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life, as it were, that every passer-by may see them. Yet, because of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their very obviousness, the general run of people disregard such truths"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"or at least they do not make them the object of any conscious knowledge."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"People are so blind to some of the simplest facts in every-day life that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"they are highly surprised when somebody calls attention to what"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"everybody ought to know. Examples of The Columbus Egg lie around us in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hundreds of thousands; but observers like Columbus are rare."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Walking about in the garden of Nature, most men have the self-conceit to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"think that they know everything; yet almost all are blind to one of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"outstanding principles that Nature employs in her work. This principle"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"may be called the inner isolation which characterizes each and every"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"living species on this earth."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that all the innumerable"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fundamental law--one may call it an iron law of Nature--which compels"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the various species to keep within the definite limits of their own"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind. Each animal"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mates only with one of its own species. The titmouse cohabits only with"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the titmouse, the finch with the finch, the stork with the stork, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"field-mouse with the field-mouse, the house-mouse with the house-mouse,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the wolf with the she-wolf, etc."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Deviations from this law take place only in exceptional circumstances."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This happens especially under the compulsion of captivity, or when some"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"other obstacle makes procreative intercourse impossible between"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"individuals of the same species. But then Nature abhors such intercourse"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"with all her might; and her protest is most clearly demonstrated by the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fact that the hybrid is either sterile or the fecundity of its"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"descendants is limited. In most cases hybrids and their progeny are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"denied the ordinary powers of resistance to disease or the natural means"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of defence against outer attack."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Such a dispensation of Nature is quite logical. Every crossing between"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"two breeds which are not quite equal results in a product which holds an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intermediate place between the levels of the two parents. This means"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that the offspring will indeed be superior to the parent which stands in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the biologically lower order of being, but not so high as the higher"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"parent. For this reason it must eventually succumb in any struggle"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"against the higher species. Such mating contradicts the will of Nature"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"towards the selective improvements of life in general. The favourable"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"preliminary to this improvement is not to mate individuals of higher and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"lower orders of being but rather to allow the complete triumph of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"higher order. The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel, and if he does so"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"it is merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind; for if"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"such a law did not direct the process of evolution then the higher"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"development of organic life would not be conceivable at all."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This urge for the maintenance of the unmixed breed, which is a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"phenomenon that prevails throughout the whole of the natural world,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"results not only in the sharply defined outward distinction between one"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"species and another but also in the internal similarity of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"characteristic qualities which are peculiar to each breed or species."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The fox remains always a fox, the goose remains a goose, and the tiger"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"will retain the character of a tiger. The only difference that can exist"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"within the species must be in the various degrees of structural strength"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and active power, in the intelligence, efficiency, endurance, etc., with"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which the individual specimens are endowed. It would be impossible to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"find a fox which has a kindly and protective disposition towards geese,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"just as no cat exists which has a friendly disposition towards mice."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"That is why the struggle between the various species does not arise from"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a feeling of mutual antipathy but rather from hunger and love. In both"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cases Nature looks on calmly and is even pleased with what happens. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"struggle for the daily livelihood leaves behind in the ruck everything"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that is weak or diseased or wavering; while the fight of the male to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"possess the female gives to the strongest the right, or at least, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"possibility to propagate its kind. And this struggle is a means of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"furthering the health and powers of resistance in the species. Thus it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is one of the causes underlying the process of development towards a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"higher quality of being."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If the case were different the progressive process would cease, and even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"retrogression might set in. Since the inferior always outnumber the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"superior, the former would always increase more rapidly if they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"possessed the same capacities for survival and for the procreation of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their kind; and the final consequence would be that the best in quality"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would be forced to recede into the background. Therefore a corrective"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"measure in favour of the better quality must intervene. Nature supplies"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this by establishing rigorous conditions of life to which the weaker"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"will have to submit and will thereby be numerically restricted; but even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that portion which survives cannot indiscriminately multiply, for here a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"new and rigorous selection takes place, according to strength and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"health."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"with an inferior one; because in such a case all her efforts, throughout"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"stage of being, may thus be rendered futile."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"History furnishes us with innumerable instances that prove this law. It"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"shows, with a startling clarity, that whenever Aryans have mingled their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"blood with that of an inferior race the result has been the downfall of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the people who were the standard-bearers of a higher culture. In North"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"America, where the population is prevalently Teutonic, and where those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"elements intermingled with the inferior race only to a very small"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"degree, we have a quality of mankind and a civilization which are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"different from those of Central and South America. In these latter"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"countries the immigrants--who mainly belonged to the Latin races--mated"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"with the aborigines, sometimes to a very large extent indeed. In this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"case we have a clear and decisive example of the effect produced by the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mixture of races. But in North America the Teutonic element, which has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"kept its racial stock pure and did not mix it with any other racial"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"stock, has come to dominate the American Continent and will remain"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"master of it as long as that element does not fall a victim to the habit"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of adulterating its blood."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In short, the results of miscegenation are always the following:"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(a) The level of the superior race becomes lowered;"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(b) physical and mental degeneration sets in, thus leading slowly but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"steadily towards a progressive drying up of the vital sap."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The act which brings about such a development is a sin against the will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Eternal Creator. And as a sin this act will be avenged."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Man's effort to build up something that contradicts the iron logic of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Nature brings him into conflict with those principles to which he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"himself exclusively owes his own existence. By acting against the laws"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of Nature he prepares the way that leads to his ruin."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Here we meet the insolent objection, which is Jewish in its inspiration"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and is typical of the modern pacifist. It says: Man can control even
Nature."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"There are millions who repeat by rote that piece of Jewish babble and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"end up by imagining that somehow they themselves are the conquerors of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Nature. And yet their only weapon is just a mere idea, and a very"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"preposterous idea into the bargain; because if one accepted it, then it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would be impossible even to imagine the existence of the world."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The real truth is that, not only has man failed to overcome Nature in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"any sphere whatsoever but that at best he has merely succeeded in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"getting hold of and lifting a tiny corner of the enormous veil which she"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"has spread over her eternal mysteries and secret. He never creates"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"anything. All he can do is to discover something. He does not master"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Nature but has only come to be the master of those living beings who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have not gained the knowledge he has arrived at by penetrating into some"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of Nature's laws and mysteries. Apart from all this, an idea can never"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"subject to its own sway those conditions which are necessary for the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"existence and development of mankind; for the idea itself has come only"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"from man. Without man there would be no human idea in this world. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"idea as such is therefore always dependent on the existence of man and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"consequently is dependent on those laws which furnish the conditions of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his existence."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"And not only that. Certain ideas are even confined to certain people."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This holds true with regard to those ideas in particular which have not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their roots in objective scientific truth but in the world of feeling."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In other words, to use a phrase which is current to-day and which well"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and clearly expresses this truth: THEY REFLECT AN INNER EXPERIENCE. All"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"such ideas, which have nothing to do with cold logic as such but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"represent mere manifestations of feeling, such as ethical and moral"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"conceptions, etc., are inextricably bound up with man's existence. It is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to the creative powers of man's imagination that such ideas owe their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"existence."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Now, then, a necessary condition for the maintenance of such ideas is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the existence of certain races and certain types of men. For example,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"anyone who sincerely wishes that the pacifist idea should prevail in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this world ought to do all he is capable of doing to help the Germans"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"conquer the world; for in case the reverse should happen it may easily"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be that the last pacifist would disappear with the last German. I say"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this because, unfortunately, only our people, and no other people in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world, fell a prey to this idea. Whether you like it or not, you would"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have to make up your mind to forget wars if you would achieve the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pacifist ideal. Nothing less than this was the plan of the American"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world-redeemer, Woodrow Wilson. Anyhow that was what our visionaries"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"believed, and they thought that through his plans their ideals would be"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"attained."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The pacifist-humanitarian idea may indeed become an excellent one when"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the most superior type of manhood will have succeeded in subjugating the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world to such an extent that this type is then sole master of the earth."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure according"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to which its application would become difficult and finally impossible."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"So, first of all, the fight and then pacifism. If the case were"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"different it would mean that mankind has already passed the zenith of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"its development, and accordingly the end would not be the supremacy of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"some moral ideal but degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"People may laugh at this statement; but our planet has been moving"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"through the spaces of ether for millions and millions of years,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily begin to do so"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"again--if men should forget that wherever they have reached a superior"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"level of existence, it was not the result of following the ideas of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"laws of Nature."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"All that we admire in the world to-day, its science, its art, its"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"technical developments and discoveries, are the products of the creative"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"activities of a few peoples, and it may be true that their first"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"beginnings must be attributed to one race. The maintenance of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilization is wholly dependent on such peoples. Should they perish,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them into the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"grave."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"However great, for example, be the influence which the soil exerts on"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"men, this influence will always vary according to the race in which it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"produces its effect. Dearth of soil may stimulate one race to the most"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"strenuous efforts and highest achievement; while, for another race, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"poverty of the soil may be the cause of misery and finally of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"undernourishment, with all its consequences. The internal"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"characteristics of a people are always the causes which determine the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nature of the effect that outer circumstances have on them. What reduces"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"one race to starvation trains another race to harder work."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"All the great civilizations of the past became decadent because the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"originally creative race died out, as a result of contamination of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"blood."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The most profound cause of such a decline is to be found in the fact"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that the people ignored the principle that all culture depends on men,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and not the reverse. In other words, in order to preserve a certain"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"culture, the type of manhood that creates such a culture must be"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"preserved. But such a preservation goes hand-in-hand with the inexorable"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"law that it is the strongest and the best who must triumph and that they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have the right to endure."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He who would live must fight. He who does not wish to fight in this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exist."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Such a saying may sound hard; but, after all, that is how the matter"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"really stands. Yet far harder is the lot of him who believes that he can"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"overcome Nature and thus in reality insults her. Distress, misery, and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"disease are her rejoinders."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Whoever ignores or despises the laws of race really deprives himself of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the happiness to which he believes he can attain. For he places an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"obstacle in the victorious path of the superior race and, by so doing,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he interferes with a prerequisite condition of all human progress."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Loaded with the burden of humanitarian sentiment, he falls back to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"level of those who are unable to raise themselves in the scale of being."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It would be futile to attempt to discuss the question as to what race or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"races were the original standard-bearers of human culture and were"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thereby the real founders of all that we understand by the word"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"humanity. It is much simpler to deal with this question in so far as it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"relates to the present time. Here the answer is simple and clear. Every"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"technical skill, which we see before our eyes to-day, is almost"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power. This very fact"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fully justifies the conclusion that it was the Aryan alone who founded a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"superior type of humanity; therefore he represents the architype of what"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"we understand by the term: MAN. He is the Prometheus of mankind, from"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"forth, always kindling anew that fire which, in the form of knowledge,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"illuminated the dark night by drawing aside the veil of mystery and thus"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"showing man how to rise and become master over all the other beings on"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the earth. Should he be forced to disappear, a profound darkness will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"descend on the earth; within a few thousand years human culture will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"vanish and the world will become a desert."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If we divide mankind into three categories--founders of culture, bearers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of culture, and destroyers of culture--the Aryan alone can be considered"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as representing the first category. It was he who laid the groundwork"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and erected the walls of every great structure in human culture. Only"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the shape and colour of such structures are to be attributed to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"individual characteristics of the various nations. It is the Aryan who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"has furnished the great building-stones and plans for the edifices of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all human progress; only the way in which these plans have been executed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is to be attributed to the qualities of each individual race. Within a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"culture and called such a culture its own, whereas the basis of that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"culture was the Greek mind and Teutonic skill as we know it. Only the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"external form--at least to a certain degree--shows the traits of an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Asiatic inspiration. It is not true, as some believe, that Japan adds"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"European technique to a culture of her own. The truth rather is that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"European science and technics are just decked out with the peculiar"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"characteristics of Japanese civilization. The foundations of actual life"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in Japan to-day are not those of the native Japanese culture, although"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this characterizes the external features of the country, which features"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"difference from us; but the real foundations of contemporary Japanese"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life are the enormous scientific and technical achievements of Europe"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and America, that is to say, of Aryan peoples. Only by adopting these"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"achievements as the foundations of their own progress can the various"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nations of the Orient take a place in contemporary world progress. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"scientific and technical achievements of Europe and America provide the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"basis on which the struggle for daily livelihood is carried on in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Orient. They provide the necessary arms and instruments for this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"struggle, and only the outer forms of these instruments have become"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gradually adapted to Japanese ways of life."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If, from to-day onwards, the Aryan influence on Japan would cease--and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"if we suppose that Europe and America would collapse--then the present"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress of Japan in science and technique might still last for a short"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"duration; but within a few decades the inspiration would dry up, and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"native Japanese character would triumph, while the present civilization"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would become fossilized and fall back into the sleep from which it was"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"aroused about seventy years ago by the impact of Aryan culture. We may"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"therefore draw the conclusion that, just as the present Japanese"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"development has been due to Aryan influence, so in the immemorial past"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"an outside influence and an outside culture brought into existence the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Japanese culture of that day. This opinion is very strongly supported by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the fact that the ancient civilization of Japan actually became"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fossilizied and petrified. Such a process of senility can happen only if"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a people loses the racial cell which originally had been creative or if"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the outside influence should be withdrawn after having awakened and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"maintained the first cultural developments in that region. If it be"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"shown that a people owes the fundamental elements of its culture to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"foreign races, assimilating and elaborating such elements, and if"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"subsequently that culture becomes fossilized whenever the external"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"influence ceases, then such a race may be called the depository but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"never the creator of a culture."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If we subject the different peoples to a strict test from this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"standpoint we shall find that scarcely any one of them has originally"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"created a culture, but almost all have been merely the recipients of a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"culture created elsewhere."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This development may be depicted as always happening somewhat in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"following way:"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Aryan tribes, often almost ridiculously small in number, subjugated"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"foreign peoples and, stimulated by the conditions of life which their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"new country offered them (fertility, the nature of the climate, etc.),"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and profiting also by the abundance of manual labour furnished them by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the inferior race, they developed intellectual and organizing faculties"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which had hitherto been dormant in these conquering tribes. Within the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"course of a few thousand years, or even centuries, they gave life to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cultures whose primitive traits completely corresponded to the character"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the founders, though modified by adaptation to the peculiarities of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the soil and the characteristics of the subjugated people. But finally"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the conquering race offended against the principles which they first had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"observed, namely, the maintenance of their racial stock unmixed, and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"they began to intermingle with the subjugated people. Thus they put an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"end to their own separate existence; for the original sin committed in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Paradise has always been followed by the expulsion of the guilty"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"parties."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"After a thousand years or more the last visible traces of those former"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"masters may then be found in a lighter tint of the skin which the Aryan"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"blood had bequeathed to the subjugated race, and in a fossilized culture"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of which those Aryans had been the original creators. For just as the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"blood. of the conqueror, who was a conqueror not only in body but also"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in spirit, got submerged in the blood of the subject race, so the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"substance disappeared out of which the torch of human culture and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress was kindled. In so far as the blood of the former ruling race"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"has left a light nuance of colour in the blood of its descendants, as a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"token and a memory, the night of cultural life is rendered less dim and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"dark by a mild light radiated from the products of those who were the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"bearers of the original fire. Their radiance shines across the barbarism"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to which the subjected race has reverted and might often lead the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"superficial observer to believe that he sees before him an image of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"present race when he is really looking into a mirror wherein only the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"past is reflected."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It may happen that in the course of its history such a people will come"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"into contact a second time, and even oftener, with the original founders"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of their culture and may not even remember that distant association."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Instinctively the remnants of blood left from that old ruling race will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be drawn towards this new phenomenon and what had formerly been possible"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only under compulsion can now be successfully achieved in a voluntary"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"way. A new cultural wave flows in and lasts until the blood of its"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"standard-bearers becomes once again adulterated by intermixture with the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"originally conquered race."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It will be the task of those who set themselves to the study of a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"universal history of civilization to investigate history from this point"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of view instead of allowing themselves to be smothered under the mass of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"external data, as is only too often the case with our present historical"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"science."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This short sketch of the changes that take place among those races that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"are only the depositories of a culture also furnishes a picture of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"development and the activity and the disappearance of those who are the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"true founders of culture on this earth, namely the Aryans themselves."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Just as in our daily life the so-called man of genius needs a particular"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"occasion, and sometimes indeed a special stimulus, to bring his genius"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to light, so too in the life of the peoples the race that has genius in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"it needs the occasion and stimulus to bring that genius to expression."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In the monotony and routine of everyday life even persons of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"significance seem just like the others and do not rise beyond the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"average level of their fellow-men. But as soon as such men find"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves in a special situation which disconcerts and unbalances the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"others, the humble person of apparently common qualities reveals traits"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of genius, often to the amazement of those who have hitherto known him"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the small things of everyday life. That is the reason why a prophet"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only seldom counts for something in his own country. War offers an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"excellent occasion for observing this phenomenon. In times of distress,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"when the others despair, apparently harmless boys suddenly spring up and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"become heroes, full of determination, undaunted in the presence of Death"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and manifesting wonderful powers of calm reflection under such"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"circumstances. If such an hour of trial did not come nobody would have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thought that the soul of a hero lurked in the body of that beardless"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"youth. A special impulse is almost always necessary to bring a man of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"genius into the foreground. The sledge-hammer of Fate which strikes down"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the one so easily suddenly finds the counter-impact of steel when it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"strikes at the other. And, after the common shell of everyday life is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"broken, the core that lay hidden in it is displayed to the eyes of an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"astonished world. This surrounding world then grows obstinate and will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not believe that what had seemed so like itself is really of that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"different quality so suddenly displayed. This is a process which is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"repeated probably every time a man of outstanding significance appears."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Though an inventor, for example, does not establish his fame until the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"very day that he carries through his invention, it would be a mistake to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"believe that the creative genius did not become alive in him until that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"moment. From the very hour of his birth the spark of genius is living"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"within the man who has been endowed with the real creative faculty. True"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"genius is an innate quality. It can never be the result of education or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"training."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"As I have stated already, this holds good not merely of the individual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"but also of the race. Those peoples who manifest creative abilities in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"certain periods of their history have always been fundamentally"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"creative. It belongs to their very nature, even though this fact may"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"escape the eyes of the superficial observer. Here also recognition from"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"outside is only the consequence of practical achievement. Since the rest"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the world is incapable of recognizing genius as such, it can only see"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the visible manifestations of genius in the form of inventions,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"discoveries, buildings, painting, etc.; but even here a long time passes"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"before recognition is given. Just as the individual person who has been"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"endowed with the gift of genius, or at least talent of a very high"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"order, cannot bring that endowment to realization until he comes under"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the urge of special circumstances, so in the life of the nations the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"creative capacities and powers frequently have to wait until certain"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"conditions stimulate them to action."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The most obvious example of this truth is furnished by that race which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"has been, and still is, the standard-bearer of human progress: I mean"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Aryan race. As soon as Fate brings them face to face with special"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"circumstances their powers begin to develop progressively and to be"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"manifested in tangible form. The characteristic cultures which they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"create under such circumstances are almost always conditioned by the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"soil, the climate and the people they subjugate. The last factor--that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the character of the people--is the most decisive one. The more"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"primitive the technical conditions under which the civilizing activity"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"takes place, the more necessary is the existence of manual labour which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"can be organized and employed so as to take the place of mechanical"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"power. Had it not been possible for them to employ members of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"inferior race which they conquered, the Aryans would never have been in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a position to take the first steps on the road which led them to a later"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"type of culture; just as, without the help of certain suitable animals"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which they were able to tame, they would never have come to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"invention of mechanical power which has subsequently enabled them to do"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without these beasts. The phrase, 'The Moor has accomplished his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"function, so let him now depart', has, unfortunately, a profound"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"application. For thousands of years the horse has been the faithful"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"servant of man and has helped him to lay the foundations of human"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress, but now motor power has dispensed with the use of the horse."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In a few years to come the use of the horse will cease entirely; and yet"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without its collaboration man could scarcely have come to the stage of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"development which he has now created."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"For the establishment of superior types of civilization the members of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"inferior races formed one of the most essential pre-requisites. They"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"alone could supply the lack of mechanical means without which no"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress is possible. It is certain that the first stages of human"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilization were not based so much on the use of tame animals as on the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"employment of human beings who were members of an inferior race."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Only after subjugated races were employed as slaves was a similar fate"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"allotted to animals, and not vice versa, as some people would have us"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"believe. At first it was the conquered enemy who had to draw the plough"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and only afterwards did the ox and horse take his place. Nobody else but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"puling pacifists can consider this fact as a sign of human degradation."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Such people fail to recognize that this evolution had to take place in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"order that man might reach that degree of civilization which these"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"apostles now exploit in an attempt to make the world pay attention to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their rigmarole."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The progress of mankind may be compared to the process of ascending an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"infinite ladder. One does not reach the higher level without first"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"having climbed the lower rungs. The Aryan therefore had to take that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"road which his sense of reality pointed out to him and not that which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the modern pacifist dreams of. The path of reality is, however,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"difficult and hard to tread; yet it is the only one which finally leads"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to the goal where the others envisage mankind in their dreams. But the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"real truth is that those dreamers help only to lead man away from his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"goal rather than towards it."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It was not by mere chance that the first forms of civilization arose"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"there where the Aryan came into contact with inferior races, subjugated"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"them and forced them to obey his command. The members of the inferior"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"race became the first mechanical tools in the service of a growing"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilization."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Thereby the way was clearly indicated which the Aryan had to follow. As"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a conqueror, he subjugated inferior races and turned their physical"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"powers into organized channels under his own leadership, forcing them to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"follow his will and purpose. By imposing on them a useful, though hard,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"manner of employing their powers he not only spared the lives of those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"whom he had conquered but probably made their lives easier than these"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"had been in the former state of so-called 'freedom'. While he ruthlessly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"maintained his position as their master, he not only remained master but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he also maintained and advanced civilization. For this depended"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exclusively on his inborn abilities and, therefore, on the preservation"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Aryan race as such. As soon, however, as his subject began to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"rise and approach the level of their conqueror, a phase of which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"ascension was probably the use of his language, the barriers that had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"distinguished master from servant broke down. The Aryan neglected to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"maintain his own racial stock unmixed and therewith lost the right to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"live in the paradise which he himself had created. He became submerged"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the racial mixture and gradually lost his cultural creativeness,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"until he finally grew, not only mentally but also physically, more like"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the aborigines whom he had subjected rather than his own ancestors. For"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"some time he could continue to live on the capital of that culture which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"still remained; but a condition of fossilization soon set in and he sank"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"into oblivion."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"That is how cultures and empires decline and yield their places to new"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"formations."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The adulteration of the blood and racial deterioration conditioned"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thereby are the only causes that account for the decline of ancient"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilizations; for it is never by war that nations are ruined, but by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the loss of their powers of resistance, which are exclusively a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"characteristic of pure racial blood. In this world everything that is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not of sound racial stock is like chaff. Every historical event in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world is nothing more nor less than a manifestation of the instinct of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"racial self-preservation, whether for weal or woe."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The question as to the ground reasons for the predominant importance of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Aryanism can be answered by pointing out that it is not so much that the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Aryans are endowed with a stronger instinct for self-preservation, but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"rather that this manifests itself in a way which is peculiar to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves. Considered from the subjective standpoint, the will-to-live"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is of course equally strong all round and only the forms in which it is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"expressed are different. Among the most primitive organisms the instinct"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for self-preservation does not extend beyond the care of the individual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"ego. Egotism, as we call this passion, is so predominant that it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"includes even the time element; which means that the present moment is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"deemed the most important and that nothing is left to the future. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"animal lives only for itself, searching for food only when it feels"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hunger and fighting only for the preservation of its own life. As long"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as the instinct for self-preservation manifests itself exclusively in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"such a way, there is no basis for the establishment of a community; not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"even the most primitive form of all, that is to say the family. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"society formed by the male with the female, where it goes beyond the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mere conditions of mating, calls for the extension of the instinct of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"self-preservation, since the readiness to fight for one's own ego has to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be extended also to the mate. The male sometimes provides food for the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"female, but in most cases both parents provide food for the offspring."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Almost always they are ready to protect and defend each other; so that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"here we find the first, though infinitely simple, manifestation of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"spirit of sacrifice. As soon as this spirit extends beyond the narrow"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"limits of the family, we have the conditions under which larger"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"associations and finally even States can be formed."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The lowest species of human beings give evidence of this quality only to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a very small degree, so that often they do not go beyond the formation"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the family society. With an increasing readiness to place their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"immediate personal interests in the background, the capacity for"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"organizing more extensive communities develops."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The readiness to sacrifice one's personal work and, if necessary, even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"one's life for others shows its most highly developed form in the Aryan"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"race. The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"powers, but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"service of the community. Here the instinct for self-preservation has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"reached its noblest form; for the Aryan willingly subordinates his own"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"ego to the common weal and when necessity calls he will even sacrifice"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his own life for the community."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The constructive powers of the Aryan and that peculiar ability he has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for the building up of a culture are not grounded in his intellectual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gifts alone. If that were so they might only be destructive and could"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"never have the ability to organize; for the latter essentially depends"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"on the readiness of the individual to renounce his own personal opinions"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and interests and to lay both at the service of the human group. By"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"serving the common weal he receives his reward in return. For example,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he does not work directly for himself but makes his productive work a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"part of the activity of the group to which he belongs, not only for his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"own benefit but for the general. The spirit underlying this attitude is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"expressed by the word: WORK, which to him does not at all signify a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"means of earning one's daily livelihood but rather a productive activity"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which cannot clash with the interests of the community. Whenever human"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"activity is directed exclusively to the service of the instinct for"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"self-preservation it is called theft or usury, robbery or burglary, etc."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This mental attitude, which forces self-interest to recede into the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"background in favour of the common weal, is the first prerequisite for"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"any kind of really human civilization. It is out of this spirit alone"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that great human achievements have sprung for which the original doers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have scarcely ever received any recompense but which turns out to be the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"source of abundant benefit for their descendants. It is this spirit"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"alone which can explain why it so often happens that people can endure a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"harsh but honest existence which offers them no returns for their toil"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"except a poor and modest livelihood. But such a livelihood helps to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"consolidate the foundations on which the community exists. Every worker"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and every peasant, every inventor, state official, etc., who works"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without ever achieving fortune or prosperity for himself, is a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"representative of this sublime idea, even though he may never become"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"conscious of the profound meaning of his own activity."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Everything that may be said of that kind of work which is the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fundamental condition of providing food and the basic means of human"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress is true even in a higher sense of work that is done for the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"Where can another people be found that in the course of the last two"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thousand years has undergone so few changes in mental outlook and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"will-to-live, to preserve one's kind, is demonstrated by that fact!"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The intellectual faculties of the Jew have been trained through"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thousands of years. To-day the Jew is looked upon as specially"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'cunning'; and in a certain sense he has been so throughout the ages."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"His intellectual powers, however, are not the result of an inner"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"evolution but rather have been shaped by the object-lessons which the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew has received from others. The human spirit cannot climb upwards"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without taking successive steps. For every step upwards it needs the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"foundation of what has been constructed before--the past--which in, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"comprehensive sense here employed, can have been laid only in a general"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilization. All thinking originates only to a very small degree in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"personal experience. The largest part is based on the accumulated"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"experiences of the past. The general level of civilization provides the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"such an abundance of preliminary knowledge that with this equipment he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"can more easily take further steps on the road of progress. The boy of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to-day, for example, grows up among such an overwhelming mass of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"technical achievement which has accumulated during the last century that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he takes as granted many things which a hundred years ago were still"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mysteries even to the greatest minds of those times. Yet these things"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that are not so much a matter of course are of enormous importance to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"those who would understand the progress we have made in these matters"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and would carry on that progress a step farther. If a man of genius"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"belonging to the 'twenties of the last century were to arise from his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"grave to-day he would find it more difficult to understand our present"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"age than the contemporary boy of fifteen years of age who may even have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only an average intelligence. The man of genius, thus come back from the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"past, would need to provide himself with an extraordinary amount of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"preliminary information which our contemporary youth receive"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"automatically, so to speak, during the time they are growing up among"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the products of our modern civilization."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Since the Jew--for reasons that I shall deal with immediately--never had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a civilization of his own, he has always been furnished by others with a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"basis for his: intellectual work. His intellect has always developed by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the use of those cultural achievements which he has found ready-to-hand"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"around him."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The process has never been the reverse."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"For, though among the Jews the instinct of self-preservation has not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been weaker but has been much stronger than among other peoples, and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"though the impression may easily be created that the intellectual powers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Jew are at least equal to those of other races, the Jews"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"completely lack the most essential pre-requisite of a cultural people,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"namely the idealistic spirit. With the Jewish people the readiness for"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"sacrifice does not extend beyond the simple instinct of individual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"preservation. In their case the feeling of racial solidarity which they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"apparently manifest is nothing but a very primitive gregarious instinct,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"similar to that which may be found among other organisms in this world."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It is a remarkable fact that this herd instinct brings individuals"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"together for mutual protection only as long as there is a common danger"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which makes mutual assistance expedient or inevitable. The same pack of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"wolves which a moment ago joined together in a common attack on their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"victim will dissolve into individual wolves as soon as their hunger has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been satisfied. This is also sure of horses, which unite to defend"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves against any aggressor but separate the moment the danger is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"over."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It is much the same with the Jew. His spirit of sacrifice is only"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"apparent. It manifests itself only so long as the existence of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"individual makes this a matter of absolute necessity. But as soon as the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"common foe is conquered and the danger which threatened the individual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jews is overcome and the prey secured, then the apparent harmony"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"disappears and the original conditions set in again. Jews act in concord"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only when a common danger threatens them or a common prey attracts them."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Where these two motives no longer exist then the most brutal egotism"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"appears and these people who before had lived together in unity will"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"turn into a swarm of rats that bitterly fight against each other."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If the Jews were the only people in the world they would be wallowing in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"filth and mire and would exploit one another and try to exterminate one"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"another in a bitter struggle, except in so far as their utter lack of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the ideal of sacrifice, which shows itself in their cowardly spirit,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would prevent this struggle from developing."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Therefore it would be a complete mistake to interpret the mutual help"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which the Jews render one another when they have to fight--or, to put it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"more accurately, to exploit--their fellow being, as the expression of a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"certain idealistic spirit of sacrifice."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Here again the Jew merely follows the call of his individual egotism."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"That is why the Jewish State, which ought to be a vital organization to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"serve the purpose of preserving or increasing the race, has absolutely"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"no territorial boundaries. For the territorial delimitation of a State"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"always demands a certain idealism of spirit on the part of the race"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which forms that State and especially a proper acceptance of the idea of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"work. A State which is territorially delimited cannot be established or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"maintained unless the general attitude towards work be a positive one."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If this attitude be lacking, then the necessary basis of a civilization"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is also lacking."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"That is why the Jewish people, despite the intellectual powers with"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which they are apparently endowed, have not a culture--certainly not a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"culture of their own. The culture which the Jew enjoys to-day is the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"product of the work of others and this product is debased in the hands"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Jew."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In order to form a correct judgment of the place which the Jew holds in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"relation to the whole problem of human civilization, we must bear in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mind the essential fact that there never has been any Jewish art and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"consequently that nothing of this kind exists to-day. We must realize"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that especially in those two royal domains of art, namely architecture"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and music, the Jew has done no original creative work. When the Jew"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"comes to producing something in the field of art he merely bowdler-izes"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"something already in existence or simply steals the intellectual word,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of others. The Jew essentially lacks those qualities which are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"characteristic of those creative races that are the founders of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"civilization."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"To what extent the Jew appropriates the civilization built up by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"others--or rather corrupts it, to speak more accurately--is indicated by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the fact that he cultivates chiefly the art which calls for the smallest"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"amount of original invention, namely the dramatic art. And even here he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is nothing better than a kind of juggler or, perhaps more correctly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"speaking, a kind of monkey imitator; for in this domain also he lacks"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the creative elan which is necessary for the production of all really"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"great work. Even here, therefore, he is not a creative genius but rather"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a superficial imitator who, in spite of all his retouching and tricks,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cannot disguise the fact that there is no inner vitality in the shape he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gives his products. At this juncture the Jewish Press comes in and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"renders friendly assistance by shouting hosannas over the head of even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the most ordinary bungler of a Jew, until the rest of the world is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"stampeded into thinking that the object of so much praise must really be"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"an artist, whereas in reality he may be nothing more than a low-class"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mimic."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"No; the Jews have not the creative abilities which are necessary to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"founding of a civilization; for in them there is not, and never has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been, that spirit of idealism which is an absolutely necessary element"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the higher development of mankind. Therefore the Jewish intellect"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"will never be constructive but always destructive. At best it may serve"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as a stimulus in rare cases but only within the meaning of the poet's"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"lines: 'THE POWER WHICH ALWAYS WILLS THE BAD, AND ALWAYS WORKS THE GOOD'"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(KRAFT, DIE STETS DAS BÖSE WILL UND STETS DAS GUTE SCHAFFT). (Note 15) It"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is not through his help but in spite of his help that mankind makes any"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progress."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"[Note 15. When Mephistopheles first appears to Faust, in the latter's"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"study, Faust inquires: What is thy name? To which Mephistopheles"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"replies: A part ofthe Power which always wills the Bad and always works
the Good. And when Faust asks him what is meant by this riddle and why he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"should call himself'a part,' the gist of Mephistopheles' reply is that he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is the Spirit of Negation and exists through opposition to the positive"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Truth and Order and Beauty which proceed from the never-ending creative"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"energy of the Deity. In the Prologue to Faust the Lord declares that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"therefore he has to be aroused by the Spirit of Opposition. This Spirit"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"wills the Bad, but of itself it can do nothing positive, and by its"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"opposition always works the opposite of what it wills.]"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Since the Jew has never had a State which was based on territorial"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"delimitations, and therefore never a civilization of his own, the idea"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"arose that here we were dealing with a people who had to be considered"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as Nomads. That is a great and mischievous mistake. The true nomad does"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"actually possess a definite delimited territory where he lives. It is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"merely that he does not cultivate it, as the settled farmer does, but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that he lives on the products of his herds, with which he wanders over"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his domain. The natural reason for this mode of existence is to be found"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the fact that the soil is not fertile and that it does not give the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"steady produce which makes a fixed abode possible. Outside of this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"natural cause, however, there is a more profound cause: namely, that no"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mechanical civilization is at hand to make up for the natural poverty of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the region in question. There are territories where the Aryan can"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"establish fixed settlements by means of the technical skill which he has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"developed in the course of more than a thousand years, even though these"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"territories would otherwise have to be abandoned, unless the Aryan were"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"willing to wander about them in nomadic fashion; but his technical"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"tradition and his age-long experience of the use of technical means"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would probably make the nomadic life unbearable for him. We ought to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"remember that during the first period of American colonization numerous"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Aryans earned their daily livelihood as trappers and hunters, etc.,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"frequently wandering about in large groups with their women and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"children, their mode of existence very much resembling that of ordinary"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nomads. The moment, however, that they grew more numerous and were able"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to accumulate larger resources, they cleared the land and drove out the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"aborigines, at the same time establishing settlements which rapidly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"increased all over the country."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The Aryan himself was probably at first a nomad and became a settler in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the course of ages. But yet he was never of the Jewish kind. The Jew is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not a nomad; for the nomad has already a definite attitude towards the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"concept of 'work', and this attitude served as the basis of a later"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cultural development, when the necessary intellectual conditions were at"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hand. There is a certain amount of idealism in the general attitude of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the nomad, even though it be rather primitive. His whole character may,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"therefore, be foreign to Aryan feeling but it will never be repulsive."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"But not even the slightest trace of idealism exists in the Jewish"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"character. The Jew has never been a nomad, but always a parasite,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"battening on the substance of others. If he occasionally abandoned"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"regions where he had hitherto lived he did not do it voluntarily. He did"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"it because from time to time he was driven out by people who were tired"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of having their hospitality abused by such guests. Jewish self-expansion"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is a parasitic phenomenon--since the Jew is always looking for new"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pastures for his race."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"But this has nothing to do with nomadic life as such; because the Jew"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"does not ever think of leaving a territory which he has once occupied."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He sticks where he is with such tenacity that he can hardly be driven"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"out even by superior physical force. He expands into new territories"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only when certain conditions for his existence are provided therein; but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"even then--unlike the nomad--he will not change his former abode. He is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and remains a parasite, a sponger who, like a pernicious bacillus,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"spreads over wider and wider areas according as some favourable area"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"attracts him. The effect produced by his presence is also like that of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the vampire; for wherever he establishes himself the people who grant"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"him hospitality are bound to be bled to death sooner or later. Thus the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew has at all times lived in States that have belonged to other races"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and within the organization of those States he had formed a State of his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"own, which is, however, hidden behind the mask of a 'religious"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"community', as long as external circumstances do not make it advisable"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for this community to declare its true nature. As soon as the Jew feels"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"himself sufficiently established in his position to be able to hold it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without a disguise, he lifts the mask and suddenly appears in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"character which so many did not formerly believe or wish to see: namely"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that of the Jew."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The life which the Jew lives as a parasite thriving on the substance of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"other nations and States has resulted in developing that specific"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"character which Schopenhauer once described when he spoke of the Jew as"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'The Great Master of Lies'. The kind of existence which he leads forces"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Jew to the systematic use of falsehood, just as naturally as the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"inhabitants of northern climates are forced to wear warm clothes."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He can live among other nations and States only as long as he succeeds"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in persuading them that the Jews are not a distinct people but the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"representatives of a religious faith who thus constitute a 'religious"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"community', though this be of a peculiar character."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"As a matter of fact, however, this is the first of his great falsehoods."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He is obliged to conceal his own particular character and mode of life"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that he may be allowed to continue his existence as a parasite among the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nations. The greater the intelligence of the individual Jew, the better"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"will he succeed in deceiving others. His success in this line may even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"go so far that the people who grant him hospitality may be led to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"believe that the Jew among them is a genuine Frenchman, for instance, or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Englishman or German or Italian, who just happens to belong to a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"religious denomination which is different from that prevailing in these"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"countries. Especially in circles concerned with the executive"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"administration of the State, where the officials generally have only a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"minimum of historical sense, the Jew is able to impose his infamous"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"deception with comparative ease. In these circles independent thinking"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is considered a sin against the sacred rules according to which official"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"promotion takes place. It is therefore not surprising that even to-day"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the Bavarian government offices, for example, there is not the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"slightest suspicion that the Jews form a distinct nation themselves and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"are not merely the adherents of a 'Confession', though one glance at the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Press which belongs to the Jews ought to furnish sufficient evidence to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the contrary even for those who possess only the smallest degree of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intelligence. The JEWISH ECHO, however, is not an official gazette and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"Jewry has always been a nation of a definite racial character and never"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"differentiated merely by the fact of belonging to a certain religion. At"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a very early date, urged on by the desire to make their way in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"world, the Jews began to cast about for a means whereby they might"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"distract such attention as might prove inconvenient for them. What could"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be more effective and at the same time more above suspicion than to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"borrow and utilize the idea of the religious community? Here also"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"everything is copied, or rather stolen; for the Jew could not possess"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"any religious institution which had developed out of his own"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"consciousness, seeing that he lacks every kind of idealism; which means"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that belief in a life beyond this terrestrial existence is foreign to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"him. In the Aryan mind no religion can ever be imagined unless it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"embodies the conviction that life in some form or other will continue"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"after death. As a matter of fact, the Talmud is not a book that lays"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"down principles according to which the individual should prepare for the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life to come. It only furnishes rules for a practical and convenient"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life in this world."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The religious teaching of the Jews is principally a collection of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"instructions for maintaining the Jewish blood pure and for regulating"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intercourse between Jews and the rest of the world: that is to say,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their relation with non-Jews. But the Jewish religious teaching is not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"concerned with moral problems. It is rather concerned with economic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"problems, and very petty ones at that. In regard to the moral value of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the religious teaching of the Jews there exist and always have existed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"quite exhaustive studies (not from the Jewish side; for whatever the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jews have written on this question has naturally always been of a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"tendentious character) which show up the kind of religion that the Jews"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have in a light that makes it look very uncanny to the Aryan mind. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew himself is the best example of the kind of product which this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"religious training evolves. His life is of this world only and his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mentality is as foreign to the true spirit of Christianity as his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"character was foreign to the great Founder of this new creed two"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thousand years ago. And the Founder of Christianity made no secret"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"indeed of His estimation of the Jewish people. When He found it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"necessary He drove those enemies of the human race out of the Temple of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"God; because then, as always, they used religion as a means of advancing"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their commercial interests. But at that time Christ was nailed to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Cross for his attitude towards the Jews; whereas our modern Christians"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"enter into party politics and when elections are being held they debase"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves to beg for Jewish votes. They even enter into political"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intrigues with the atheistic Jewish parties against the interests of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"their own Christian nation."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"On this first and fundamental lie, the purpose of which is to make"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people believe that Jewry is not a nation but a religion, other lies are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"subsequently based. One of those further lies, for example, is in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"connection with the language spoken by the Jew. For him language is not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"an instrument for the expression of his inner thoughts but rather a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"means of cloaking them. When talking French his thoughts are Jewish and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"when writing German rhymes he only gives expression to the character of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his own race."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"As long as the Jew has not succeeded in mastering other peoples he is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"forced to speak their language whether he likes it or not. But the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"moment that the world would become the slave of the Jew it would have to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"learn some other language (Esperanto, for example) so that by this means"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Jew could dominate all the more easily."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"How much the whole existence of this people is based on a permanent"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"falsehood is proved in a unique way by 'The Protocols of the Elders of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Zion', which are so violently repudiated by the Jews. With groans and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"moans, the FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG repeats again and again that these are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"forgeries. This alone is evidence in favour of their authenticity. What"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"many Jews unconsciously wish to do is here clearly set forth. It is not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"necessary to ask out of what Jewish brain these revelations sprang; but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"what is of vital interest is that they disclose, with an almost"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"terrifying precision, the mentality and methods of action characteristic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Jewish people and these writings expound in all their various"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"directions the final aims towards which the Jews are striving. The study"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of real happenings, however, is the best way of judging the authenticity"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of those documents. If the historical developments which have taken"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"place within the last few centuries be studied in the light of this book"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"we shall understand why the Jewish Press incessantly repudiates and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"denounces it. For the Jewish peril will be stamped out the moment the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"general public come into possession of that book and understand it."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In order to get to know the Jew properly it is necessary to study the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"road which he has been following among the other peoples during the last"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"few centuries. One example will suffice to give a clear insight here."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Since his career has been the same at all epochs--just as the people at"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"whose expense he has lived have remained the same--for the purposes of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"making the requisite analysis it will be best to mark his progress by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"stages. For the sake of simplicity we shall indicate these stages by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"letters of the alphabet."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The first Jews came into what was then called Germania during the period"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the Roman invasion; and, as usual, they came as merchants. During the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"turmoil caused by the great migrations of the German tribes the Jews"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"seem to have disappeared. We may therefore consider the period when the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Germans formed the first political communities as the beginning of that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"process whereby Central and Northern Europe was again, and this time"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"permanently, Judaized. A development began which has always been the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"same or similar wherever and whenever Jews came into contact with Aryan"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"peoples."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(a) As soon as the first permanent settlements had been established the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew was suddenly 'there'. He arrived as a merchant and in the beginning"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"did not trouble to disguise his nationality. He still remained openly a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew, partly it may be because he knew too little of the language. It may"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"also be that people of other races refused to mix with him, so that he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"could not very well adopt any other appearance than that of a foreign"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"merchant. Because of his subtlety and cunning and the lack of experience"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"on the part of the people whose guest he became, it was not to his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"disadvantage openly to retain his Jewish character. This may even have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been advantageous to him; for the foreigner was received kindly."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(b) Slowly but steadily he began to take part in the economic life"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"around him; not as a producer, however, but only as a middleman. His"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"commercial cunning, acquired through thousands of years of negotiation"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as an intermediary, made him superior in this field to the Aryans, who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"were still quite ingenuous and indeed clumsy and whose honesty was"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"unlimited; so that after a short while commerce seemed destined to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"become a Jewish monopoly. The Jew began by lending out money at usurious"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"interest, which is a permanent trade of his. It was he who first"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"introduced the payment of interest on borrowed money. The danger which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this innovation involved was not at first recognized; indeed the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"innovation was welcomed, because it offered momentary advantages."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(c) At this stage the Jew had become firmly settled down; that is to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"say, he inhabited special sections of the cities and towns and had his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"own quarter in the market-places. Thus he gradually came to form a State"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"within a State. He came to look upon the commercial domain and all money"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"transactions as a privilege belonging exclusively to himself and he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exploited it ruthlessly."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(d) At this stage finance and trade had become his complete monopoly."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Finally, his usurious rate of interest aroused opposition and the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"increasing impudence which the Jew began to manifest all round stirred"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"up popular indignation, while his display of wealth gave rise to popular"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"envy. The cup of his iniquity became full to the brim when he included"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"landed property among his commercial wares and degraded the soil to the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"level of a market commodity. Since he himself never cultivated the soil"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"but considered it as an object to be exploited, on which the peasant may"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"still remain but only on condition that he submits to the most heartless"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exactions of his new master, public antipathy against the Jew steadily"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"increased and finally turned into open animosity. His extortionate"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"tyranny became so unbearable that people rebelled against his control"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and used physical violence against him. They began to scrutinize this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"foreigner somewhat more closely, and then began to discover the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"repulsive traits and characteristics inherent in him, until finally an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"abyss opened between the Jews and their hosts, across which abyss there"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"could be no further contact."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In times of distress a wave of public anger has usually arisen against"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Jew; the masses have taken the law into their own hands; they have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"seized Jewish property and ruined the Jew in their urge to protect"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves against what they consider to be a scourge of God. Having"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"come to know the Jew intimately through the course of centuries, in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"times of distress they looked upon his presence among them as a public"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"danger comparable only to the plague."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(e) But then the Jew began to reveal his true character. He paid court"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to governments, with servile flattery, used his money to ingratiate"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"himself further and thus regularly secured for himself once again the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"privilege of exploiting his victim. Although public wrath flared up"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"against this eternal profiteer and drove him out, after a few years he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"reappeared in those same places and carried on as before. No persecution"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"could force him to give up his trade of exploiting other people and no"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"amount of harrying succeeded in driving him out permanently. He always"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"returned after a short time and it was always the old story with him."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In an effort to save at least the worst from happening, legislation was"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"passed which debarred the Jew from obtaining possession of the land."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(f) In proportion as the powers of kings and princes increased, the Jew"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"sidled up to them. He begged for 'charters' and 'privileges' which those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gentlemen, who were generally in financial straits, gladly granted if"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"they received adequate payment in return. However high the price he has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to pay, the Jew will succeed in getting it back within a few years from"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"operating the privilege he has acquired, even with interest and compound"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"interest. He is a real leech who clings to the body of his unfortunate"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"victims and cannot be removed; so that when the princes found themselves"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in need once again they took the blood from his swollen veins with their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"own hands."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"This game was repeated unendingly. In the case of those who were called"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'German Princes', the part they played was quite as contemptible as that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"played by the Jew. They were a real scourge for their people. Their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"compeers may be found in some of the government ministers of our time."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It was due to the German princes that the German nation could not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"succeed in definitely freeing itself from the Jewish peril."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Unfortunately the situation did not change at a later period. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"princes finally received the reward which they had a thousand-fold"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"deserved for all the crimes committed by them against their own people."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"They had allied themselves with Satan and later on they discovered that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"they were in Satan's embrace."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(g) By permitting themselves to be entangled in the toils of the Jew,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the princes prepared their own downfall. The position which they held"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"among their people was slowly but steadily undermined not only by their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"continued failure to guard the interests of their subjects but by the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"positive exploitation of them. The Jew calculated exactly the time when"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the downfall of the princes was approaching and did his best to hasten"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"it. He intensified their financial difficulties by hindering them in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exercise of their duty towards their people, by inveigling them through"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the most servile flatteries into further personal display, whereby he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"made himself more and more indispensable to them. His astuteness, or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"rather his utter unscrupulousness, in money affairs enabled him to exact"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"new income from the princes, to squeeze the money out of them and then"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have it spent as quickly as possible. Every Court had its 'Court Jews',"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as this plague was called, who tortured the innocent victims until they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"were driven to despair; while at the same time this Jew provided the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"means which the princes squandered on their own pleasures. It is not to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be wondered at that these ornaments of the human race became the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"recipients of official honours and even were admitted into the ranks of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the hereditary nobility, thus contributing not only to expose that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"social institution to ridicule but also to contaminate it from the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"inside."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Naturally the Jew could now exploit the position to which he had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"attained and push himself forward even more rapidly than before. Finally"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he became baptized and thus entitled to all the rights and privileges"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which belonged to the children of the nation on which he preyed. This"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"was a high-class stroke of business for him, and he often availed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"himself of it, to the great joy of the Church, which was proud of having"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gained a new child in the Faith, and also to the joy of Israel, which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"was happy at seeing the trick pulled off successfully."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(h) At this stage a transformation began to take place in the world of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jewry. Up to now they had been Jews--that is to say, they did not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hitherto set any great value on pretending to be something else; and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"anyhow the distinctive characteristics which separated them from other"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"races could not be easily overcome. Even as late as the time of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Frederick the Great nobody looked upon the Jews as other than a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'foreign' people, and Goethe rose up in revolt against the failure"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"legally to prohibit marriage between Christians and Jews. Goethe was"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"certainly no reactionary and no time-server. What he said came from the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"voice of the blood and the voice of reason. Notwithstanding the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"disgraceful happenings taking place in Court circles, the people"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"recognized instinctively that the Jew was the foreign body in their own"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"flesh and their attitude towards him was directed by recognition of that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fact."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"But a change was now destined to take place. In the course of more than"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a thousand years the Jew had learned to master the language of his hosts"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"so thoroughly that he considered he might now lay stress on his Jewish"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"character and emphasize the 'Germanism' a bit more. Though it must have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"appeared ridiculous and absurd at first sight, he was impudent enough to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"call himself a 'Teuton', which in this case meant a German. In that way"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"began one of the most infamous impositions that can be imagined. The Jew"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"did not possess the slightest traces of the German character. He had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only acquired the art of twisting the German language to his own uses,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and that in a disgusting way, without having assimilated any other"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"feature of the German character. Therefore his command of the language"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"was the sole ground on which he could pretend to be a German. It is not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"however by the tie of language, but exclusively by the tie of blood that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the members of a race are bound together. And the Jew himself knows this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"better than any other, seeing that he attaches so little importance to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the preservation of his own language while at the same time he strives"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his utmost to maintain his blood free from intermixture with that of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"other races. A man may acquire and use a new language without much"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"trouble; but it is only his old ideas that he expresses through the new"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"language. His inner nature is not modified thereby. The best proof of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this is furnished by the Jew himself. He may speak a thousand tongues"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and yet his Jewish nature will remain always one and the same. His"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"distinguishing characteristics were the same when he spoke the Latin"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"language at Ostia two thousand years ago as a merchant in grain, as they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"are to-day when he tries to sell adulterated flour with the aid of his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"German gibberish. He is always the same Jew. That so obvious a fact is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not recognized by the average head-clerk in a German government"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"department, or by an officer in the police administration, is also a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"self-evident and natural fact; since it would be difficult to find"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"another class of people who are so lacking in instinct and intelligence"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as the civil servants employed by our modern German State authorities."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The reason why, at the stage I am dealing with, the Jew so suddenly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"decided to transform himself into a German is not difficult to discover."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He felt the power of the princes slowly crumbling and therefore looked"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"about to find a new social plank on which he might stand. Furthermore,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his financial domination over all the spheres of economic life had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"become so powerful that he felt he could no longer sustain that enormous"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"structure or add to it unless he were admitted to the full enjoyment of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the 'rights of citizenship.' He aimed at both, preservation and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"expansion; for the higher he could climb the more alluring became the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"prospect of reaching the old goal, which was promised to him in ancient"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"times, namely world-rulership, and which he now looked forward to with"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"feverish eyes, as he thought he saw it visibly approaching. Therefore"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all his efforts were now directed to becoming a fully-fledged citizen,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"endowed with all civil and political rights."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"That was the reason for his emancipation from the Ghetto."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(i) And thus the Court Jew slowly developed into the national Jew. But"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"naturally he still remained associated with persons in higher quarters"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and he even attempted to push his way further into the inner circles of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the ruling set. But at the same time some other representatives of his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"race were currying favour with the people. If we remember the crimes the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew had committed against the masses of the people in the course of so"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"many centuries, how repeatedly and ruthlessly he exploited them and how"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"he sucked out even the very marrow of their substance, and when we"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"further remember how they gradually came to hate him and finally"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"considered him as a public scourge--then we may well understand how"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"difficult the Jew must have found this final transformation. Yes,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"indeed, it must tax all their powers to be able to present themselves as"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'friends of humanity' to the poor victims whom they have skinned raw."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Therefore the Jew began by making public amends for the crimes which he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"had committed against the people in the past. He started his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"metamorphosis by first appearing as the 'benefactor' of humanity. Since"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his new philanthropic policy had a very concrete aim in view, he could"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not very well apply to himself the biblical counsel, not to allow the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"left hand to know what the right hand is giving. He felt obliged to let"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as many people as possible know how deeply the sufferings of the masses"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"grieved him and to what excesses of personal sacrifice he was ready to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"go in order to help them. With this manifestation of innate modesty, so"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"typical of the Jew, he trumpeted his virtues before the world until"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"finally the world actually began to believe him. Those who refused to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"share this belief were considered to be doing him an injustice. Thus"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"after a little while he began to twist things around, so as to make it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"appear that it was he who had always been wronged, and vice versa. There"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"were really some particularly foolish people who could not help pitying"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"this poor unfortunate creature of a Jew."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Attention may be called to the fact that, in spite of his proclaimed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"readiness to make personal sacrifices, the Jew never becomes poor"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thereby. He has a happy knack of always making both ends meet."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Occasionally his benevolence might be compared to the manure which is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not spread over the field merely for the purpose of getting rid of it,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"but rather with a view to future produce. Anyhow, after a comparatively"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"short period of time, the world was given to know that the Jew had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"become a general benefactor and philanthropist. What a transformation!"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"What is looked upon as more or less natural when done by other people"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"here became an object of astonishment, and even sometimes of admiration,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"because it was considered so unusual in a Jew. That is why he has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"received more credit for his acts of benevolence than ordinary mortals."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"And something more: The Jew became liberal all of a sudden and began to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"talk enthusiastically of how human progress must be encouraged."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Gradually he assumed the air of being the herald of a new age."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Yet at the same time he continued to undermine the ground-work of that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"part of the economic system in which the people have the most practical"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"interest. He bought up stock in the various national undertakings and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"thus pushed his influence into the circuit of national production,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"making this latter an object of buying and selling on the stock"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exchange, or rather what might be called the pawn in a financial game of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"chess, and thus ruining the basis on which personal proprietorship alone"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"is possible. Only with the entrance of the Jew did that feeling of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"estrangement, between employers and employees begin which led at a later"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"date to the political class-struggle."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Finally the Jew gained an increasing influence in all economic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"undertakings by means of his predominance in the stock-exchange. If not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the ownership, at least he secured control of the working power of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nation."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In order to strengthen his political position, he directed his efforts"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"towards removing the barrier of racial and civic discrimination which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"had hitherto hindered his advance at every turn. With characteristic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"tenacity he championed the cause of religious tolerance for this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"purpose; and in the freemason organization, which had fallen completely"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"into his hands, he found a magnificent weapon which helped him to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"achieve his ends. Government circles, as well as the higher sections of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the political and commercial bourgeoisie, fell a prey to his plans"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"through his manipulation of the masonic net, though they themselves did"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"not even suspect what was happening."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Only the people as such, or rather the masses which were just becoming"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"conscious of their own power and were beginning to use it in the fight"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for their rights and liberties, had hitherto escaped the grip of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew. At least his influence had not yet penetrated to the deeper and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"wider sections of the people. This was unsatisfactory to him. The most"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"important phase of his policy was therefore to secure control over the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people. The Jew realized that in his efforts to reach the position of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"public despot he would need a 'peace-maker.' And he thought he could"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"find a peace-maker if he could whip-in sufficient extensive sections of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the bourgeois. But the freemasons failed to catch the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"glove-manufacturers and the linen-weavers in the frail meshes of their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"net. And so it became necessary to find a grosser and withal a more"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"effective means. Thus another weapon beside that of freemasonry would"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have to be secured. This was the Press. The Jew exercised all his skill"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and tenacity in getting hold of it. By means of the Press he began"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gradually to control public life in its entirety. He began to drive it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"along the road which he had chosen to reach his own ends; for he was now"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in a position to create and direct that force which, under the name of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'public opinion' is better known to-day than it was some decades ago."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Simultaneously the Jew gave himself the air of thirsting after"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"knowledge. He lauded every phase of progress, particularly those phases"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which led to the ruin of others; for he judges all progress and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"development from the standpoint of the advantages which these bring to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his own people. When it brings him no such advantages he is the deadly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"enemy of enlightenment and hates all culture which is real culture as"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"such. All the knowledge which he acquires in the schools of others is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"exploited by him exclusively in the service of his own race."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Even more watchfully than ever before, he now stood guard over his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jewish nationality. Though bubbling over with 'enlightenment',"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'progress', 'liberty', 'humanity', etc., his first care was to preserve"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the racial integrity of his own people. He occasionally bestowed one of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his female members on an influential Christian; but the racial stock of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his male descendants was always preserved unmixed fundamentally. He"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"poisons the blood of others but preserves his own blood unadulterated."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The Jew scarcely ever marries a Christian girl, but the Christian takes"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a Jewess to wife. The mongrels that are a result of this latter union"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"always declare themselves on the Jewish side. Thus a part of the higher"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nobility in particular became completely degenerate. The Jew was well"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"aware of this fact and systematically used this means of disarming the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intellectual leaders of the opposite race. To mask his tactics and fool"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"his victims, he talks of the equality of all men, no matter what their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"race or colour may be. And the simpletons begin to believe him."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Since his whole nature still retains too foreign an odour for the broad"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"masses of the people to allow themselves to be caught in his snare, he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"uses the Press to put before the public a picture of himself which is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"entirely untrue to life but well designed to serve his purpose. In the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"comic papers special efforts are made to represent the Jews as an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"inoffensive little race which, like all others, has its peculiarities."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In spite of their manners, which may seem a bit strange, the comic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"papers present the Jews as fundamentally good-hearted and honourable."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Attempts are generally made to make them appear insignificant rather"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"than dangerous."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"During this phase of his progress the chief goal of the Jew was the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"victory of democracy, or rather the supreme hegemony of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"parliamentary system, which embodies his concept of democracy. This"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"institution harmonises best with his purposes; for thus the personal"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"element is eliminated and in its place we have the dunder-headed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"majority, inefficiency and, last but by no means least, knavery."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The final result must necessarily have been the overthrow of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"monarchy, which had to happen sooner or later."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"(j) A tremendous economic development transformed the social structure"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of the nation. The small artisan class slowly disappeared and the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"factory worker, who took its place, had scarcely any chance of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"establishing an independent existence of his own but sank more and more"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to the level of a proletariat. An essential characteristic of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"factory worker is that he is scarcely ever able to provide for an"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"independent source of livelihood which will support him in later life."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In the true sense of the word, he is 'disinherited'. His old age is a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"misery to him and can hardly be called life at all."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In earlier times a similar situation had been created, which had"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"imperatively demanded a solution and for which a solution was found."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Side by side with the peasant and the artisan, a new class was gradually"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"developed, namely that of officials and employees, especially those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"employed in the various services of the State. They also were a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"'disinherited' class, in the true sense of the word. But the State found"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a remedy for this unhealthy situation by taking upon itself the duty of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"providing for the State official who could establish nothing that would"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"be an independent means of livelihood for himself in his old age. Thus"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the system of pensions and retiring allowances was introduced. Private"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"enterprises slowly followed this example in increasing numbers; so that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to-day every permanent non-manual worker receives a pension in his later"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"years, if the firm which he has served is one that has reached or gone"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"beyond a certain size. It was only by virtue of the assurance given of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"State officials, that they would be cared for in their old age. that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"such a high degree of unselfish devotion to duty was developed, which in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pre-war times was one of the distinguising characteristics of German"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"officials."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Thus a whole class which had no personal property was saved from"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"destitution by an intelligent system of provision, and found a place in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the social structure of the national community."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The problem is now put before the State and nation, but this time in a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"much larger form. When the new industries sprang up and developed,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"millions of people left the countryside and the villages to take up"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"employment in the big factories. The conditions under which this new"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"class found itself forced to live were worse than miserable. The more or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"less mechanical transformation of the methods of work hitherto in vogue"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"among the artisans and peasants did not fit in well with the habits or"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mentality of this new working-class. The way in which the peasants and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"artisans had formerly worked had nothing comparable to the intensive"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"labour of the new factory worker. In the old trades time did not play a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"highly important role, but it became an essential element in the new"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"industrial system. The formal taking over of the old working hours into"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the mammoth industrial enterprises had fatal results. The actual amount"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"of work hitherto accomplished within a certain time was comparatively"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"small, because the modern methods of intensive production were then"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"unknown. Therefore, though in the older system a working day of fourteen"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"or even fifteen hours was not unendurable, now it was beyond the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"possibilities of human endurance because in the new system every minute"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"was utilized to the extreme. This absurd transference of the old working"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hours to the new industrial system proved fatal in two directions."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"First, it ruined the health of the workers; secondly, it destroyed their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"faith in a superior law of justice. Finally, on the one hand a miserable"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"wage was received and, on the other, the employer held a much more"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"lucrative position than before. Hence a striking difference between the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"ways of life on the one side and on the other."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In the open country there could be no social problem, because the master"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and the farm-hand were doing the same kind of work and doing it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"together. They ate their food in common, and sometimes even out of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"same dish. But in this sphere also the new system introduced an entirely"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"different set of conditions between masters and men."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The division created between employer and employees seems not to have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"extended to all branches of life. How far this Judaizing process has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been allowed to take effect among our people is illustrated by the fact"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that manual labour not only receives practically no recognition but is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"even considered degrading. That is not a natural German attitude. It is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"due to the introduction of a foreign element into our lives, and that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"foreign element is the Jewish spirit, one of the effects of which has"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"been to transform the high esteem in which our handicrafts once were"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"held into a definite feeling that all physical labour is something base"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and unworthy."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Thus a new social class has grown up which stands in low esteem; and the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"day must come when we shall have to face the question of whether the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nation will be able to make this class an integral part of the social"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"community or whether the difference of status now existing will become a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"permanent gulf separating this class from the others."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"One thing, however, is certain: This class does not include the worst"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"elements of the community in its ranks. Rather the contrary is the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"truth: it includes the most energetic parts of the nation. The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"sophistication which is the result of a so-called civilization has not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"yet exercised its disintegrating and degenerating influence on this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"class. The broad masses of this new lower class, constituted by the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"manual labourers, have not yet fallen a prey to the morbid weakness of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pacifism. These are still robust and, if necessary, they can be brutal."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"While our bourgeoisie middle class paid no attention at all to this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"momentous problem and indifferently allowed events to take their course,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Jew seized upon the manifold possibilities which the situation"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"offered him for the future. While on the one hand he organized"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"capitalistic methods of exploitation to their ultimate degree of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"efficiency, he curried favour with the victims of his policy and his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"power and in a short while became the leader of their struggle against"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"himself. 'Against himself' is here only a figurative way of speaking;"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for this 'Great Master of Lies' knows how to appear in the guise of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"innocent and throw the guilt on others. Since he had the impudence to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"take a personal lead among the masses, they never for a moment suspected"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"that they were falling a prey to one of the most infamous deceits ever"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"practised. And yet that is what it actually was."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The moment this new class had arisen out of the general economic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"situation and taken shape as a definite body in the social order, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew saw clearly where he would find the necessary pacemaker for his own"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"progressive march. At first he had used the bourgeois class as a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"battering-ram against the feudal order; and now he used the worker"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"against the bourgeois world. Just as he succeeded in obtaining civic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"rights by intrigues carried on under the protection of the bourgeois"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"class, he now hoped that by joining in the struggle which the workers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"were waging for their own existence he would be able to obtain full"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"control over them."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"When that moment arrives, then the only objective the workers will have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to fight for will be the future of the Jewish people. Without knowing"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"it, the worker is placing himself at the service of the very power"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"against which he believes he is fighting. Apparently he is made to fight"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"against capital and thus he is all the more easily brought to fight for"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"capitalist interests. Outcries are systematically raised against"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"international capital but in reality it is against the structure of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"national economics that these slogans are directed. The idea is to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"demolish this structure and on its ruins triumphantly erect the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"structure of the International Stock Exchange."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"In this line of action the procedure of the Jew was as follows:"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He kowtowed to the worker, hypocritically pretended to feel pity for him"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and his lot, and even to be indignant at the misery and poverty which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the worker had to endure. That is the way in which the Jew endeavoured"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to gain the confidence of the working class. He showed himself eager to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"study their various hardships, whether real or imaginary, and strove to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"awaken a yearning on the part of the workers to change the conditions"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"under which they lived. The Jew artfully enkindled that innate yearning"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for social justice which is a typical Aryan characteristic. Once that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"yearning became alive it was transformed into hatred against those in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"more fortunate circumstances of life. The next stage was to give a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"precise philosophical aspect to the struggle for the elimination of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"social wrongs. And thus the Marxist doctrine was invented."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"By presenting his doctrine as part and parcel of a just revindication of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"social rights, the Jew propagated the doctrine all the more effectively."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"But at the same time he provoked the opposition of decent people who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"refused to admit these demands which, because of the form and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pseudo-philosophical trimmings in which they are presented, seemed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fundamentally unjust and impossible for realization. For, under the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cloak of purely social concepts there are hidden aims which are of a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Satanic character. These aims are even expounded in the open with the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"clarity of unlimited impudence. This Marxist doctrine is an individual"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mixture of human reason and human absurdity; but the combination is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"arranged in such a way that only the absurd part of it could ever be put"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"into practice, but never the reasonable part of it. By categorically"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"repudiating the personal worth of the individual and also the nation and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"its racial constituent, this doctrine destroys the fundamental basis of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all civilization; for civilization essentially depends on these very"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"factors. Such is the true essence of the Marxist WELTANSCHAUUNG, so far"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"as the word WELTANSCHAUUNG can be applied at all to this phantom"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"arising from a criminal brain. The destruction of the concept of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"personality and of race removes the chief obstacle which barred the way"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to domination of the social body by its inferior elements, which are the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jews."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The very absurdity of the economic and political theories of Marxism"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"gives the doctrine its peculiar significance. Because of its"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"pseudo-logic, intelligent people refuse to support it, while all those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"who are less accustomed to use their intellectual faculties, or who have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only a rudimentary notion of economic principles, join the Marxist cause"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"with flying banners. The intelligence behind the movement--for even this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"movement needs intelligence if it is to subsist--is supplied by the Jews"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"themselves, naturally of course as a gratuitous service which is at the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"same time a sacrifice on their part."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Thus arose a movement which was composed exclusively of manual workers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"under the leadership of Jews. To all external appearances, this movement"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"strives to ameliorate the conditions under which the workers live; but"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in reality its aim is to enslave and thereby annihilate the non-Jewish"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"races."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The propaganda which the freemasons had carried on among the so-called"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"intelligentsia, whereby their pacifist teaching paralysed the instinct"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"for national self-preservation, was now extended to the broad masses of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the workers and bourgeoisie by means of the Press, which was almost"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"everywhere in Jewish hands. To those two instruments of disintegration a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"third and still more ruthless one was added, namely, the organization of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"brute physical force among the masses. As massed columns of attacks, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Marxist troops stormed those parts of the social order which had been"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"left standing after the two former undermining operations had done their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"work."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The combined activity of all these forces has been marvellously managed."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"And it will not be surprising if it turns out that those institutions"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which have always appeared as the organs of the more or less traditional"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"authority of the State should now fall before the Marxist attack. Among"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"our higher and highest State officials, with very few exceptions, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew has found the cost complacent backers in his work of destruction. An"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"attitude of sneaking servility towards 'superiors' and supercilious"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"arrogance towards 'inferiors' are the characteristics of this class of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people, as well as a grade of stupidity which is really frightening and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"at the same time a towering self-conceit, which has been so consistently"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"developed to make it amusing."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"But these qualities are of the greatest utility to the Jew in his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"dealings with our authorities. Therefore they are qualities which he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"appreciates most in the officials."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"If I were to sketch roughly the actual struggle which is now beginning I"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"should describe it somewhat thus:"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Not satisfied with the economic conquest of the world, but also"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"demanding that it must come under his political control, the Jew"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"subdivides the organized Marxist power into two parts, which correspond"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to the ultimate objectives that are to be fought for in this struggle"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which is carried on under the direction of the Jew. To outward"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"appearance, these seem to be two independent movements, but in reality"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"they constitute an indivisible unity. The two divisions are: The"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"political movement and the trades union movement."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The trades union movement has to gather in the recruits. It offers"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"assistance and protection to the workers in the hard struggle which they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have to wage for the bare means of existence, a struggle which has been"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"occasioned by the greediness and narrow-mindedness of many of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"industrialists. Unless the workers be ready to surrender all claims to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"an existence which the dignity of human nature itself demands, and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"unless they are ready to submit their fate to the will of employers who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in many cases have no sense of human responsibilities and are utterly"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"callous to human wants, then the worker must necessarily take matters"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"into his own hands, seeing that the organized social community--that is"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to say, the State--pays no attention to his needs."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The so-called national-minded bourgeoisie, blinded by its own material"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"interests, opposes this life-or-death struggle of the workers and places"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the most difficult obstacles in their way. Not only does this"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"bourgeoisie hinder all efforts to enact legislation which would shorten"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the inhumanly long hours of work, prohibit child-labour, grant security"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"not genuinely intend to find remedies for the social wrong: he pursues"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"only one objective, namely, to gather and consolidate a body of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"followers who will act under his commands as an armed weapon in the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"and, on the other, that of safeguarding the independence of the economic"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"life of the nation, the Jew does not take these poles into account at"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all. The destruction of both is one of his main objects. He would ruin,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"rather than safeguard, the independence of the national economic system."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Therefore, as the leader of the trades union movement, he has no"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"scruples about putting forward demands which not only go beyond the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"declared purpose of the movement but could not be carried into effect"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"without ruining the national economic structure. On the other hand, he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"has no interest in seeing a healthy and sturdy population develop; he"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would be more content to see the people degenerate into an unthinking"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"herd which could be reduced to total subjection. Because these are his"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"final objectives, he can afford to put forward the most absurd claims."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"He knows very well that these claims can never be realized and that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"therefore nothing in the actual state of affairs could be altered by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"that they will be enabled better to understand the causes of their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"misery. Or the same end might be achieved if the government authorities"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"would get rid of the Jew and his work. For as long as the masses remain"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"remains as indifferent to their lot as it now is, the masses will follow"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"with the general brutality and rapacity of his nature, he turns the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"violence. The resistance of those whose common sense has hitherto saved"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"terrorization. The success of that kind of activity is enormous."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Parallel with this, the political organization advances. It operates"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hand-in-hand with the trades union movement, inasmuch as the latter"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"prepares the masses for the political organization and even forces them"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"ignorant readers, the political and trades union organizations are"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"provided with an instrument which prepares the lowest stratum of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"of the purpose of this Press to inspire its readers with ideals which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"that one really cannot be surprised if in the imagination of our people"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Jew is pictured as the incarnation of Satan and the symbol of evil."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"The ignorance of the broad masses as regards the inner character of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"anyone whom the Jew thus attacks with lies and calumny, the common"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people are credulous of everything, whether because of their ignorance"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"a robe of silence, but more frequently they persecute the victims of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jewish attacks in order to stop the campaign in the Jewish Press. To the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"fatuous mind of the government official such a line of conduct appears"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"to belong to the policy of upholding the authority of the State and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"not only can he now afford to call himself a Jew once again, but he even"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"acknowledges freely and openly what his ideas are on racial and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"the simple-minded Gentile. They have not the slightest intention of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"building up a Jewish State in Palestine so as to live in it. What they"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"really are aiming at is to establish a central organization for their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"organized under the Marxist banners he has found a weapon which makes it"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"possible for him to discard democracy, so as to subjugate and rule in a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"dictatorial fashion by the aid of brute force. He is systematically"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"working in two ways to bring about this revolution. These ways are the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"economic and the political respectively."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Aided by international influences, he forms a ring of enemies around"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"those nations which have proved themselves too sturdy for him in"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"Economically he brings about the destruction of the State by a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"systematic method of sabotaging social enterprises until these become so"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"costly that they are taken out of the hands of the State and then"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"submitted to the control of Jewish finance. Politically he works to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"possession of political power he drops the last few veils which have"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"hitherto helped to conceal his features. Out of the democratic Jew, the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"Jew of the People, arises the 'Jew of the Blood', the tyrant of the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such a slavery. In that"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"country the Jew killed or starved thirty millions of the people, in a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"But the final consequence is not merely that the people lose all their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"If we review all the causes which contributed to bring about the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"downfall of the German people we shall find that the most profound and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"It would have been easy enough to endure the defeats suffered on the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"battlefields in August 1918. They were nothing when compared with the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"military victories which our nation had achieved. Our downfall was not"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the result of those defeats; but we were overthrown by that force which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"By neglecting the problem of preserving the racial foundations of our"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"national life, the old Empire abrogated the sole right which entitles a"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people to live on this planet. Nations that make mongrels of their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people, or allow their people to be turned into mongrels, sin against"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the Will of Eternal Providence. And thus their overthrow at the hands of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"a stronger opponent cannot be looked upon as a wrong but, on the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"contrary, as a restoration of justice. If a people refuses to guard and"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"uphold the qualities with which it has been endowed by Nature and which"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"have their roots in the racial blood, then such a people has no right to"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"Everything on this earth can be made into something better. Every defeat"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"If this unique problem be studied and compared with the other problems"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"in the school-system or of the evil influence which the Press exerts"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"over the adult population--always and everywhere these phenomena are at"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"That is why all attempts at reform, all institutions for social relief,"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"all political striving, all economic progress and all apparent increase"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in the general stock of knowledge, were doomed to be unproductive of any"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"enables it to exist--namely, the State--were not developing in inner"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"strength and stability, but, on the contrary, were visibly losing their"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"vitality. The false brilliance of the Second Empire could not disguise"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the inner weakness. And every attempt to invigorate it anew failed"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"because the main and most important problem was left out of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"consideration."	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"It would be a mistake to think that the followers of the various"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"political parties which tried to doctor the condition of the German"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"people, or even all their leaders, were bad in themselves or meant"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"wrong. Their activity even at best was doomed to fail, merely because of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"the fact that they saw nothing but the symptoms of our general malady"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"and they tried to doctor the symptoms while they overlooked the real"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"cause of the disease. If one makes a methodical study of the lines along"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"which the old Empire developed one cannot help seeing, after a careful"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"political analysis, that a process of inner degeneration had already set"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"in even at the time when the united Empire was formed and the German"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"nation began to make rapid external progress. The general situation was"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"declining, in spite of the apparent political success and in spite of"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"and the political collapse were then rapidly approaching. All the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"because they could not prevent the numerical increase in the growing"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"mass of Marxist votes, even when the bourgeois parties triumphed at the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"polls, but mainly because they themselves were already infected with the"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"competitive strife among ambitious political leaders, rather than by"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"attributing it to any opposition in principle between adversaries who"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"
"were determined to fight one another to the bitter end. During all those"	"CHAPTER XI   RACE AND PEOPLE"

"in this connection I mean to include all those hundreds of thousands who"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"have fundamentally the same longing, though in the individual cases they"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"cannot find adequate words to describe the vision that hovers before"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"now leads to a realization in a new idea."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The fact that millions of our people yearn at heart for a radical change"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"in our present conditions is proved by the profound discontent which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"exists among them. This feeling is manifested in a thousand ways. Some"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"express it in a form of discouragement and despair. Others show it in"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"resentment and anger and indignation. Among some the profound discontent"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"calls forth an attitude of indifference, while it urges others to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"violent manifestations of wrath. Another indication of this feeling may"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"be seen on the one hand in the attitude of those who abstain from voting"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"at elections and, on the other, in the large numbers of those who side"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"with the fanatical extremists of the left wing."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"To these latter people our young movement had to appeal first of all. It"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was not meant to be an organization for contented and satisfied people,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"but was meant to gather in all those who were suffering from profound"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"anxiety and could find no peace, those who were unhappy and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"discontented. It was not meant to float on the surface of the nation but"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"rather to push its roots deep among the masses."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Looked at from the purely political point of view, the situation in 1918"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was as follows: A nation had been torn into two parts. One part, which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was by far the smaller of the two, contained the intellectual classes of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the nation from which all those employed in physical labour were"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"excluded. On the surface these intellectual classes appeared to be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"national-minded, but that word meant nothing else to them except a very"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"vague and feeble concept of the duty to defend what they called the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"interests of the State, which in turn seemed identical with those of the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"dynastic regime. This class tried to defend its ideas and reach its aims"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"by carrying on the fight with the aid of intellectual weapons, which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"could be used only here and there and which had only a superficial"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"effect against the brutal measures employed by the adversaries, in the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"face of which the intellectual weapons were of their very nature bound"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"to fail. With one violent blow the class which had hitherto governed was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"now struck down. It trembled with fear and accepted every humiliation"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"imposed on it by the merciless victor."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Over against this class stood the broad masses of manual labourers who"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were organized in movements with a more or less radically Marxist"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"tendency. These organized masses were firmly determined to break any"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"kind of intellectual resistance by the use of brute force. They had no"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"nationalist tendencies whatsoever and deliberately repudiated the idea"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"of advancing the interests of the nation as such. On the contrary, they"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"promoted the interests of the foreign oppressor. Numerically this class"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"embraced the majority of the population and, what is more important,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"included all those elements of the nation without whose collaboration a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"national resurgence was not only a practical impossibility but was even"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"inconceivable."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"For already in 1918 one thing had to be clearly recognized; namely, that"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"no resurgence of the German nation could take place until we had first"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"restored our national strength to face the outside world. For this"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"purpose arms are not the preliminary necessity, though our bourgeois"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"'statesmen' always blathered about it being so; what was wanted was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"will-power. At one time the German people had more than sufficient"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"military armament. And yet they were not able to defend their liberty"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"because they lacked those energies which spring from the instinct of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"national self-preservation and the will to hold on to one's own. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"best armament is only dead and worthless material as long as the spirit"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"is wanting which makes men willing and determined to avail themselves of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"such weapons. Germany was rendered defenceless not because she lacked"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"To-day our Left-wing politicians in particular are constantly insisting"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that their craven-hearted and obsequious foreign policy necessarily"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"results from the disarmament of Germany, whereas the truth is that this"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"is the policy of traitors. To all that kind of talk the answer ought to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"be: No, the contrary is the truth. Your action in delivering up the arms"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was dictated by your anti-national and criminal policy of abandoning the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"interests of the nation. And now you try to make people believe that"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"But the politicians of the Right deserve exactly the same reproach. It"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was through their miserable cowardice that those ruffians of Jews who"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"came into power in 1918 were able to rob the nation of its arms. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"the central seat of the organization are shown to be firmly established."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"In the political sphere it may often happen that this supremacy can be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"maintained only when the movement has taken over supreme political"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"control of the nation."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Having taken all these considerations into account, the following"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"principles were laid down for the inner structure of the movement:"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(a) That at the beginning all activity should be concentrated in one"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"town: namely, Munich. That a band of absolutely reliable followers"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"should be trained and a school founded which would subsequently help to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"propagate the idea of the movement. That the prestige of the movement,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"for the sake of its subsequent extension, should first be established"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"here through gaining as many successful and visible results as possible"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"in this one place. To secure name and fame for the movement and its"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"leader it was necessary, not only to give in this one town a striking"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"example to shatter the belief that the Marxist doctrine was invincible"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"but also to show that a counter-doctrine was possible."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(b) That local groups should not be established before the supremacy of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the central authority in Munich was definitely established and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"acknowledged."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(c) That District, Regional, and Provincial groups should be formed only"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"after the need for them has become evident and only after the supremacy"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"of the central authority has been satisfactorily guaranteed."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Further, that the creation of subordinate organisms must depend on"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"whether or not those persons can be found who are qualified to undertake"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the leadership of them."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Here there were only two solutions:"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(a) That the movement should acquire the necessary funds to attract and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"train intelligent people who would be capable of becoming leaders. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"personnel thus obtained could then be systematically employed according"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"as the tactical situation and the necessity for efficiency demanded."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"This solution was the easier and the more expedite. But it demanded"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"large financial resources; for this group of leaders could work in the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"movement only if they could be paid a salary."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(b) Because the movement is not in a position to employ paid officials"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"it must begin by depending on honorary helpers. Naturally this solution"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"is slower and more difficult."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"It means that the leaders of the movement have to allow vast territories"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"to lie fallow unless in these respective districts one of the members"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"comes forward who is capable and willing to place himself at the service"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"of the central authority for the purpose of organizing and directing the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"movement in the region concerned."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"It may happen that in extensive regions no such leader can be found, but"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that at the same time in other regions two or three or even more persons"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"appear whose capabilities are almost on a level. The difficulty which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"this situation involves is very great and can be overcome only with the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"passing of the years."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"For the establishment of any branch of the organization the decisive"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"condition must always be that a person can be found who is capable of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"fulfilling the functions of a leader."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Just as the army and all its various units of organization are useless"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"if there are no officers, so any political organization is worthless if"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"it has not the right kind of leaders."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"If an inspiring personality who has the gift of leadership cannot be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"found for the organization and direction of a local group it is better"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"for the movement to refrain from establishing such a group than to run"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the risk of failure after the group has been founded."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The will to be a leader is not a sufficient qualification for"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"leadership. For the leader must have the other necessary qualities."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Among these qualities will-power and energy must be considered as more"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"serviceable than the intellect of a genius. The most valuable"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"association of qualities is to be found in a combination of talent,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"determination and perseverance."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(12) The future of a movement is determined by the devotion, and even"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"intolerance, with which its members fight for their cause. They must"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"feel convinced that their cause alone is just, and they must carry it"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"through to success, as against other similar organizations in the same"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"field."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"It is quite erroneous to believe that the strength of a movement must"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"increase if it be combined with other movements of a similar kind. Any"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"expansion resulting from such a combination will of course mean an"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"increase in external development, which superficial observers might"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"consider as also an increase of power; but in reality the movement thus"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"admits outside elements which will subsequently weaken its"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"constitutional vigour."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Though it may be said that one movement is identical in character with"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"another, in reality no such identity exists. If it did exist then"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"practically there would not be two movements but only one. And whatever"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the difference may be, even if it consist only of the measure in which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the capabilities of the one set of leaders differ from those of the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"other, there it is. It is against the natural law of all development to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"couple dissimilar organisms, or the law is that the stronger must"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"overcome the weaker and, through the struggle necessary for such a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"conquest, increase the constitutional vigour and effective strength of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the victor."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"By amalgamating political organizations that are approximately alike,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"certain immediate advantages may be gained, but advantages thus gained"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"are bound in the long run to become the cause of internal weaknesses"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"which will make their appearance later on."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"A movement can become great only if the unhampered development of its"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"internal strength be safeguarded and steadfastly augmented, until"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"victory over all its competitors be secured."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"One may safely say that the strength of a movement and its right to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"existence can be developed only as long as it remains true to the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"principle that struggle is a necessary condition of its progress and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that its maximum strength will be reached only as soon as complete"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"victory has been won."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Therefore a movement must not strive to obtain successes that will be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"only immediate and transitory, but it must show a spirit of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"uncompromising perseverance in carrying through a long struggle which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"will secure for it a long period of inner growth."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"All those movements which owe their expansion to a so-called combination"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"of similar organisms, which means that their external strength is due to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"a policy of compromise, are like plants whose growth is forced in a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"hothouse. They shoot up externally but they lack that inner strength"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"which enables the natural plant to grow into a tree that will withstand"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the storms of centuries."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The greatness of every powerful organization which embodies a creative"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"idea lies in the spirit of religious devotion and intolerance with which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"it stands out against all others, because it has an ardent faith in its"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"own right. If an idea is right in itself and, furnished with the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"fighting weapons I have mentioned, wages war on this earth, then it is"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"invincible and persecution will only add to its internal strength."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The greatness of Christianity did not arise from attempts to make"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"compromises with those philosophical opinions of the ancient world which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"had some resemblance to its own doctrine, but in the unrelenting and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"fanatical proclamation and defence of its own teaching."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The apparent advance that a movement makes by associating itself with"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"other movements will be easily reached and surpassed by the steady"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"it remains independent and fights its own cause alone."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"(13) The movement ought to educate its adherents to the principle that"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"struggle must not be considered a necessary evil but as something to be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"desired in itself. Therefore they must not be afraid of the hostility"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"which their adversaries manifest towards them but they must take it as a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"necessary condition on which their whole right to existence is based."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"They must not try to avoid being hated by those who are the enemies of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"Needless to say, the public knew nothing of all this. In Munich nobody"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"knew of the existence of such a party, not even by name, except our few"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"The first step that had to be taken was to extend the narrow limits of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"this small circle and get new members, but the principal necessity was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"to utilize all the means at our command for the purpose of making the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"movement known."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"We chose the following methods: We decided to hold a monthly meeting to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"which the public would be invited. Some of the invitations were"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"typewritten, and some were written by hand. For the first few meetings"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"we distributed them in the streets and delivered them personally at"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"certain houses. Each one canvassed among his own acquaintances and tried"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"to persuade some of them to attend our meetings. The result was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"lamentable."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"I still remember once how I personally delivered eighty of these"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"invitations and how we waited in the evening for the crowds to come."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"After waiting in vain for a whole hour the chairman finally had to open"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the meeting. Again there were only seven people present, the old"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"familiar seven."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"We then changed our methods. We had the invitations written with a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"typewriter in a Munich stationer's shop and then multigraphed them."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The result was that a few more people attended our next meeting. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"number increased gradually from eleven to thirteen to seventeen, to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"twenty-three and finally to thirty-four. We collected some money within"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"HOFBRÄU HAUS FESTSAAL) as our meeting-place. It was a small hall and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"would accommodate scarcely more than 130 people. To me, however, the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"thing seemed a very daring adventure to Herr Harrer, who was then"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"chairman of the party. He was a very decent fellow; but he had an"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"A PRIORI conviction that, although I might have quite a number of good"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"qualities, I certainly did not have a talent for public speaking. Even"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"later he could not be persuaded to change his opinion. But he was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"mistaken. Twenty minutes had been allotted to me for my speech on this"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"occasion, which might be looked upon as our first public meeting."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"I talked for thirty minutes, and what I always had felt deep down in my"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"heart, without being able to put it to the test, was here proved to be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"true: I could make a good speech. At the end of the thirty minutes it"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was quite clear that all the people in the little hall had been"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"profoundly impressed. The enthusiasm aroused among them found its first"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"expression in the fact that my appeal to those present brought us"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"donations which amounted to three hundred marks. That was a great relief"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"for us. Our finances were at that time so meagre that we could not"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"afford to have our party prospectus printed, or even leaflets. Now we"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"possessed at least the nucleus of a fund from which we could pay the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"most urgent and necessary expenses."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"But the success of this first larger meeting was also important from"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"another point of view. I had already begun to introduce some young and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"fresh members into the committee. During the long period of my military"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"service I had come to know a large number of good comrades whom I was"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"now able to persuade to join our party. All of them were energetic and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"disciplined young men who, through their years of military service, had"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"been imbued with the principle that nothing is impossible and that where"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"there's a will there's a way."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The need for this fresh blood supply became evident to me after a few"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"weeks of collaboration with the new members. Herr Harrer, who was then"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"chairman of the party, was a journalist by profession, and as such he"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"was a man of general knowledge. But as leader of the party he had one"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"very serious handicap: he could not speak to the crowd. Though he did"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"his work conscientiously, it lacked the necessary driving force,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"probably for the reason that he had no oratorical gifts whatsoever. Herr"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Drexler, at that time chairman of the Munich local group, was a simple"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"working man. He, too, was not of any great importance as a speaker."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Moreover, he was not a soldier. He had never done military service, even"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"during the War. So that this man who was feeble and diffident by nature"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"had missed the only school which knows how to transform diffident and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"weakly natures into real men. Therefore neither of those two men were of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the stuff that would have enabled them to stir up an ardent and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"aside, with obstinate force and if necessary with brutal ruthlessness,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"all obstacles that stood in the path of the new idea. Such a task could"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"be carried out only by men who had been trained, body and soul, in those"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"military virtues which make a man, so to speak, agile as a greyhound,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"At that time I was still a soldier. Physically and mentally I had the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"polish of six years of service, so that in the beginning this circle"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"must have looked on me as quite a stranger. In common with my army"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"comrades, I had forgotten such phrases as: That will not go, or That
is not possible, or We ought not to take such a risk; it is too
dangerous."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The whole undertaking was of its very nature dangerous. At that time"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"there were many parts of Germany where it would have been absolutely"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"impossible openly to invite people to a national meeting that dared to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"make a direct appeal to the masses. Those who attended such meetings"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were usually dispersed and driven away with broken heads. It certainly"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"did not call for any great qualities to be able to do things in that"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"way. The largest so-called bourgeois mass meetings were accustomed to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"dissolve, and those in attendance would run away like rabbits when"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"frightened by a dog as soon as a dozen communists appeared on the scene."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The Reds used to pay little attention to those bourgeois organizations"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"where only babblers talked. They recognized the inner triviality of such"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"associations much better than the members themselves and therefore felt"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that they need not be afraid of them. On the contrary, however, they"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were all the more determined to use every possible means of annihilating"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"once and for all any movement that appeared to them to be a danger to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"their own interests. The most effective means which they always employed"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"in such cases were terror and brute force."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"The Marxist leaders, whose business consisted in deceiving and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"misleading the public, naturally hated most of all a movement whose"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"declared aim was to win over those masses which hitherto had been"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"exclusively at the service of international Marxism in the Jewish and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Stock Exchange parties. The title alone, 'German Labour party',"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"irritated them. It could easily be foreseen that at the first opportune"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"moment we should have to face the opposition of the Marxist despots, who"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were still intoxicated with their triumph in 1918."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"People in the small circles of our own movement at that time showed a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"certain amount of anxiety at the prospect of such a conflict. They"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"wanted to refrain as much as possible from coming out into the open,"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"because they feared that they might be attacked and beaten. In their"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"minds they saw our first public meetings broken up and feared that the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"movement might thus be ruined for ever. I found it difficult to defend"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"my own position, which was that the conflict should not be evaded but"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that it should be faced openly and that we should be armed with those"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"weapons which are the only protection against brute force. Terror cannot"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"be overcome by the weapons of the mind but only by counter-terror. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"success of our first public meeting strengthened my own position. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"members felt encouraged to arrange for a second meeting, even on a"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"larger scale."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Some time in October 1919 the second larger meeting took place in the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"EBERLBRÄU KELLER. The theme of our speeches was 'Brest-Litowsk and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Versailles'. There were four speakers. I talked for almost an hour, and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the success was even more striking than at our first meeting. The number"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"of people who attended had grown to more than 130. An attempt to disturb"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the proceedings was immediately frustrated by my comrades. The would-be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"disturbers were thrown down the stairs, bearing imprints of violence on"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"their heads."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"A fortnight later another meeting took place in the same hall. The"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"number in attendance had now increased to more than 170, which meant"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that the room was fairly well filled. I spoke again, and once more the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"'Deutschen REICH' in the Dachauer Strasse. The first meeting at this new"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"rendezvous had a smaller attendance than the previous meeting. There"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were just less than 140 present. The members of the committee began to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"be discouraged, and those who had always been sceptical were now"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"convinced that this falling-off in the attendance was due to the fact"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"that we were holding the meetings at too short intervals. There were"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"lively discussions, in which I upheld my own opinion that a city with"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"700,000 inhabitants ought to be able not only to stand one meeting every"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"fortnight but ten meetings every week. I held that we should not be"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"discouraged by one comparative setback, that the tactics we had chosen"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were correct, and that sooner or later success would be ours if we only"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"continued with determined perseverance to push forward on our road. This"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"whole winter of 1919-20 was one continual struggle to strengthen"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"confidence in our ability to carry the movement through to success and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"to intensify this confidence until it became a burning faith that could"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"move mountains."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Our next meeting in the small hall proved the truth of my contention."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"Our audience had increased to more than 200. The publicity effect and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"the financial success were splendid. I immediately urged that a further"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"meeting should be held. It took place in less than a fortnight, and"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"there were more than 270 people present. Two weeks later we invited our"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"followers and their friends, for the seventh time, to attend our"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"meeting. The same hall was scarcely large enough for the number that"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"came. They amounted to more than four hundred."	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"During this phase the young movement developed its inner form. Sometimes"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"we had more or less hefty discussions within our small circle. From"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"various sides--it was then just the same as it is to-day--objections"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"were made against the idea of calling the young movement a party. I have"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"always considered such criticism as a demonstration of practical"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"incapability and narrow-mindedness on the part of the critic. Those"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"objections have always been raised by men who could not differentiate"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"between external appearances and inner strength, but tried to judge the"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"movement by the high-sounding character of the name attached to it. To"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"view. And if these ends did not go beyond the destruction of the party"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"all those who come forward as protagonists and apostles of such an ideal"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"nation to keep harping on that far-off and forgotten nomenclature which"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"belongs to the ancient Germanic times and does not awaken any distinct"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"tends to mislead the people into thinking that the external trappings of"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"and who never accomplished anything positive or practical, except to"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"cultivate their own superabundant self-conceit. The new movement must"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"guard itself against an influx of people whose only recommendation is"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"to become the most powerful factor of this epoch in the influence we"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"
"exercised on public opinion. At that time my chief anxiety was that we"	"CHAPTER XII  THE FIRST STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY"

"meaning to furnish the kernel around which a closely consolidated"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"militant community could be formed. All kinds of people, with all kinds"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"of divergent opinions, are parading about at the present moment under"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the device VÖLKISCH on their banners. Before I come to deal with the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"purposes and aims of the National Socialist Labour Party I want to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"establish a clear understanding of what is meant by the concept VÖLKISCH"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"and herewith explain its relation to our party movement. The word"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"VÖLKISCH does not express any clearly specified idea. It may be"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"interpreted in several ways and in practical application it is just as"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"general as the word 'religious', for instance. It is difficult to attach"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"any precise meaning to this latter word, either as a theoretical concept"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"or as a guiding principle in practical life. The word 'religious'"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"acquires a precise meaning only when it is associated with a distinct"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"and definite form through which the concept is put into practice. To say"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"that a person is 'deeply religious' may be very fine phraseology; but,"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"generally speaking, it tells us little or nothing. There may be some few"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"people who are content with such a vague description and there may even"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"be some to whom the word conveys a more or less definite picture of the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"inner quality of a person thus described. But, since the masses of the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"people are not composed of philosophers or saints, such a vague"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"religious idea will mean for them nothing else than to justify each"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"individual in thinking and acting according to his own bent. It will not"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"lead to that practical faith into which the inner religious yearning is"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"transformed only when it leaves the sphere of general metaphysical ideas"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"and is moulded to a definite dogmatic belief. Such a belief is certainly"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"not an end in itself, but the means to an end. Yet it is a means without"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"which the end could never be reached at all. This end, however, is not"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"merely something ideal; for at the bottom it is eminently practical. We"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"must always bear in mind the fact that, generally speaking, the highest"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"ideals are always the outcome of some profound vital need, just as the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"most sublime beauty owes its nobility of shape, in the last analysis, to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the fact that the most beautiful form is the form that is best suited to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the purpose it is meant to serve."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"By helping to lift the human being above the level of mere animal"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"existence. Taking humanity as it exists to-day and taking into"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"consideration the fact that the religious beliefs which it generally"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"holds and which have been consolidated through our education, so that"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"they serve as moral standards in practical life, if we should now"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"abolish religious teaching and not replace it by anything of equal value"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the result would be that the foundations of human existence would be"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"seriously shaken. We may safely say that man does not live merely to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"serve higher ideals, but that these ideals, in their turn, furnish the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"necessary conditions of his existence as a human being. And thus the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"circle is closed."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"Of course, the word 'religious' implies some ideas and beliefs that are"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"fundamental. Among these we may reckon the belief in the immortality of"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the soul, its future existence in eternity, the belief in the existence"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"of a Higher Being, and so on. But all these ideas, no matter how firmly"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the individual believes in them, may be critically analysed by any"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"person and accepted or rejected accordingly, until the emotional concept"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"or yearning has been transformed into an active service that is governed"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"by a clearly defined doctrinal faith. Such a faith furnishes the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"practical outlet for religious feeling to express itself and thus opens"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the way through which it can be put into practice."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"Without a clearly defined belief, the religious feeling would not only"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"be worthless for the purposes of human existence but even might"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"contribute towards a general disorganization, on account of its vague"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"and multifarious tendencies."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"What I have said about the word 'religious' can also be applied to the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"term VÖLKISCH. This word also implies certain fundamental ideas. Though"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"these ideas are very important indeed, they assume such vague and"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"indefinite forms that they cannot be estimated as having a greater value"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"than mere opinions, until they become constituent elements in the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"structure of a political party. For in order to give practical force to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the ideals that grow out of a WELTANSCHAUUNG and to answer the demands"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"which are a logical consequence of such ideals, mere sentiment and inner"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"longing are of no practical assistance, just as freedom cannot be won by"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"a universal yearning for it. No. Only when the idealistic longing for"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"independence is organized in such a way that it can fight for its ideal"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"with military force, only then can the urgent wish of a people be"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"transformed into a potent reality."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"Any WELTANSCHAUUNG, though a thousandfold right and supremely"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"beneficial to humanity, will be of no practical service for the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"maintenance of a people as long as its principles have not yet become"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the rallying point of a militant movement. And, on its own side, this"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"movement will remain a mere party until is has brought its ideals to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"understanding of the nature and character and scope of this conception."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"For only on such a basis can a movement he founded which will be able to"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"the most important task of all; for the possibility of successfully"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"carrying out the idea is dependent on the successful fulfilment of that"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"task. Out of the army of millions who feel the truth of these ideas, and"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"even may understand them to some extent, one man must arise. This man"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"from economic necessity, or, at best, the natural outcome of the play of"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"political forces and impulses. Such a conception of the foundations of"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"the primordial racial forces that underlie the State, but it also leads"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"to a policy in which the importance of the individual is minimized. If"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"which underlies the general concept of life to-day. For this reason"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"alone it is out of the question and even ridiculous to think that what"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"which dogma fulfils in religious belief is parallel to the function"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"which party principles fulfil for a political party which is in the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"process of being built up. Therefore, for the conception of life that is"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"based on the folk idea it is necessary that an instrument be forged"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"which can be used in fighting for this ideal, similar to the Marxist"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"of life based on the folk idea can never be the exclusive property of a"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"gained a gigantic victory instead of finding themselves on the brink of"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the abyss. The international ideology achieved success because it was"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"organized in a militant political party which was always ready to take"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"the offensive. If hitherto the ideas opposed to the international"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"concept have had to give way before the latter the reason is that they"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"lacked a united front to fight for their cause. A doctrine which forms a"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"definite outlook on life cannot struggle and triumph by allowing the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"right of free interpretation of its general teaching, but only by"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"defining that teaching in certain articles of faith that have to be"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"accepted and incorporating it in a political organization."	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"Therefore I considered it my special duty to extract from the extensive"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"but vague contents of a general WELTANSCHAUUNG the ideas which were"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"essential and give them a more or less dogmatic form. Because of their"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"precise and clear meaning, these ideas are suited to the purpose of"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"uniting in a common front all those who are ready to accept them as"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"principles. In other words: The German National Socialist Labour Party"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"extracts the essential principles from the general conception of the"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"world which is based on the folk idea. On these principles it"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"establishes a political doctrine which takes into account the practical"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"realities of the day, the nature of the times, the available human"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"material and all its deficiencies. Through this political doctrine it is"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"
"possible to bring great masses of the people into an organization which"	"CHAPTER XIII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY"

"Already in 1920-1921 certain circles belonging to the effete bourgeois"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"class accused our movement again and again of taking up a negative"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"attitude towards the modern State. For that reason the motley gang of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"camp followers attached to the various political parties, representing a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"heterogeneous conglomeration of political views, assumed the right of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"utilizing all available means to suppress the protagonists of this young"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"movement which was preaching a new political gospel. Our opponents"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"deliberately ignored the fact that the bourgeois class itself stood for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"no uniform opinion as to what the State really meant and that the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"bourgeoisie did not and could not give any coherent definition of this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"institution. Those whose duty it is to explain what is meant when we"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"speak of the State, hold chairs in State universities, often in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"department of constitutional law, and consider it their highest duty to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"find explanations and justifications for the more or less fortunate"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"existence of that particular form of State which provides them with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their daily bread. The more absurd such a form of State is the more"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"obscure and artificial and incomprehensible are the definitions which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are advanced to explain the purpose of its existence. What, for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instance, could a royal and imperial university professor write about"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the meaning and purpose of a State in a country whose statal form"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"represented the greatest monstrosity of the twentieth century? That"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would be a difficult undertaking indeed, in view of the fact that the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"contemporary professor of constitutional law is obliged not so much to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"serve the cause of truth but rather to serve a certain definite purpose."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"And this purpose is to defend at all costs the existence of that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"monstrous human mechanism which we now call the State. Nobody can be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"surprised if concrete facts are evaded as far as possible when the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"problem of the State is under discussion and if professors adopt the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"tactics of concealing themselves in morass of abstract values and duties"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and purposes which are described as 'ethical' and 'moral'."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Generally speaking, these various theorists may be classed in three"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"groups:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"1. Those who hold that the State is a more or less voluntary association"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of men who have agreed to set up and obey a ruling authority."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This is numerically the largest group. In its ranks are to be found"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those who worship our present principle of legalized authority. In their"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"eyes the will of the people has no part whatever in the whole affair."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For them the fact that the State exists is sufficient reason to consider"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it sacred and inviolable. To accept this aberration of the human brain"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"one would have to have a sort of canine adoration for what is called the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"authority of the State. In the minds of these people the means is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"substituted for the end, by a sort of sleight-of-hand movement. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State no longer exists for the purpose of serving men but men exist for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the purpose of adoring the authority of the State, which is vested in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its functionaries, even down to the smallest official. So as to prevent"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this placid and ecstatic adoration from changing into something that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"might become in any way disturbing, the authority of the State is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"limited simply to the task of preserving order and tranquillity."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therewith it is no longer either a means or an end. The State must see"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that public peace and order are preserved and, in their turn, order and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"peace must make the existence of the State possible. All life must move"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"between these two poles. In Bavaria this view is upheld by the artful"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"politicians of the Bavarian Centre, which is called the 'Bavarian"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Populist Party'. In Austria the Black-and-Yellow legitimists adopt a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"similar attitude. In the REICH, unfortunately, the so-called"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"conservative elements follow the same line of thought."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"2. The second group is somewhat smaller in numbers. It includes those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"who would make the existence of the State dependent on some conditions"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"at least. They insist that not only should there be a uniform system of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"government but also, if possible, that only one language should be used,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"though solely for technical reasons of administration. In this view the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"authority of the State is no longer the sole and exclusive end for which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the State exists. It must also promote the good of its subjects. Ideas"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of 'freedom', mostly based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"word, enter into the concept of the State as it exists in the minds of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this group. The form of government is no longer considered inviolable"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"simply because it exists. It must submit to the test of practical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"efficiency. Its venerable age no longer protects it from being"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"criticized in the light of modern exigencies. Moreover, in this view the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"first duty laid upon the State is to guarantee the economic well-being"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the individual citizens. Hence it is judged from the practical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"standpoint and according to general principles based on the idea of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"economic returns. The chief representatives of this theory of the State"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are to be found among the average German bourgeoisie, especially our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"liberal democrats."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"3. The third group is numerically the smallest. In the State they"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"discover a means for the realization of tendencies that arise from a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"policy of power, on the part of a people who are ethnically homogeneous"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and speak the same language. But those who hold this view are not clear"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"about what they mean by 'tendencies arising from a policy of power'. A"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"common language is postulated not only because they hope that thereby"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the State would be furnished with a solid basis for the extension of its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"power outside its own frontiers, but also because they think--though"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"falling into a fundamental error by doing so--that such a common"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"language would enable them to carry out a process of nationalization in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a definite direction."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"During the last century it was lamentable for those who had to witness"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it, to notice how in these circles I have just mentioned the word"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"'Germanization' was frivolously played with, though the practice was"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"often well intended. I well remember how in the days of my youth this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"very term used to give rise to notions which were false to an incredible"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"degree. Even in Pan-German circles one heard the opinion expressed that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the Austrian Germans might very well succeed in Germanizing the Austrian"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Slavs, if only the Government would be ready to co-operate. Those people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"did not understand that a policy of Germanization can be carried out"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"only as regards human beings. What they mostly meant by Germanization"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"was a process of forcing other people to speak the German language. But"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it is almost inconceivable how such a mistake could be made as to think"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that a Nigger or a Chinaman will become a German because he has learned"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the German language and is willing to speak German for the future, and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"even to cast his vote for a German political party. Our bourgeois"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nationalists could never clearly see that such a process of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Germanization is in reality de-Germanization; for even if all the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"outstanding and visible differences between the various peoples could be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"bridged over and finally wiped out by the use of a common language, that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would produce a process of bastardization which in this case would not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"signify Germanization but the annihilation of the German element. In the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"course of history it has happened only too often that a conquering race"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"succeeded by external force in compelling the people whom they subjected"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to speak the tongue of the conqueror and that after a thousand years"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their language was spoken by another people and that thus the conqueror"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"finally turned out to be the conquered."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"What makes a people or, to be more correct, a race, is not language but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"blood. Therefore it would be justifiable to speak of Germanization only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"if that process could change the blood of the people who would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"subjected to it, which is obviously impossible. A change would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"possible only by a mixture of blood, but in this case the quality of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"superior race would be debased. The final result of such a mixture would"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be that precisely those qualities would be destroyed which had enabled"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the conquering race to achieve victory over an inferior people. It is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"especially the cultural creativeness which disappears when a superior"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"race intermixes with an inferior one, even though the resultant mongrel"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"race should excel a thousandfold in speaking the language of the race"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that once had been superior. For a certain time there will be a conflict"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"between the different mentalities, and it may be that a nation which is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in a state of progressive degeneration will at the last moment rally its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cultural creative power and once again produce striking examples of that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"power. But these results are due only to the activity of elements that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have remained over from the superior race or hybrids of the first"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"crossing in whom the superior blood has remained dominant and seeks to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"assert itself. But this will never happen with the final descendants of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"such hybrids. These are always in a state of cultural retrogression."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"We must consider it as fortunate that a Germanization of Austria"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"according to the plan of Joseph II did not succeed. Probably the result"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would have been that the Austrian State would have been able to survive,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but at the same time participation in the use of a common language would"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have debased the racial quality of the German element. In the course of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"centuries a certain herd instinct might have been developed but the herd"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"itself would have deteriorated in quality. A national State might have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"arisen, but a people who had been culturally creative would have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"disappeared."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For the German nation it was better that this process of intermixture"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"Not only in Austria, however, but also in the REICH, these so-called"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"erroneous ideas. Unfortunately, a policy towards Poland, whereby the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"East was to be Germanized, was demanded by many and was based on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"same false reasoning. Here again it was believed that the Polish people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"could be Germanized by being compelled to use the German language. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"result would have been fatal. A people of foreign race would have had to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"What has been beneficially Germanized in the course of history was the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"land which our ancestors conquered with the sword and colonized with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"German tillers of the soil. To the extent that they introduced foreign"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"blood into our national body in this colonization, they have helped to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"disintegrate our racial character, a process which has resulted in our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"In this third group also there are people who, to a certain degree,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"consider the State as an end in itself. Hence they consider its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preservation as one of the highest aims of human existence. Our analysis"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"may be summed up as follows:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"All these opinions have this common feature and failing: that they are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not grounded in a recognition of the profound truth that the capacity"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for creating cultural values is essentially based on the racial element"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and that, in accordance with this fact, the paramount purpose of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State is to preserve and improve the race; for this is an indispensable"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"condition of all progress in human civilization."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Thus the Jew, Karl Marx, was able to draw the final conclusions from"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"these false concepts and ideas on the nature and purpose of the State."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"By eliminating from the concept of the State all thought of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"obligation which the State bears towards the race, without finding any"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"other formula that might be universally accepted, the bourgeois teaching"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"prepared the way for that doctrine which rejects the State as such."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"That is why the bourgeois struggle against Marxist internationalism is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"absolutely doomed to fail in this field. The bourgeois classes have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"already sacrificed the basic principles which alone could furnish a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"of the nature and purpose of the State."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The fundamental principle is that the State is not an end in itself but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the means to an end. It is the preliminary condition under which alone a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"should disappear, all culture that is on an adequate level with the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"may go still further and say that the fact that States have been created"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"by human beings does not in the least exclude the possiblity that the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"human race may become extinct, because the superior intellectual"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculties and powers of adaptation would be lost when the racial bearer"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of these faculties and powers disappeared."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"If, for instance, the surface of the globe should be shaken to-day by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"some seismic convulsion and if a new Himalaya would emerge from the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"waves of the sea, this one catastrophe alone might annihilate human"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"civilization. No State could exist any longer. All order would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"shattered. And all vestiges of cultural products which had been evolved"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"through thousands of years would disappear. Nothing would be left but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"one tremendous field of death and destruction submerged in floods of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"water and mud. If, however, just a few people would survive this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"terrible havoc, and if these people belonged to a definite race that had"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"Only with the extermination of the last race that possesses the gift of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"that statal institutions which owe their beginnings to members of a race"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which lacks creative genius are not made of stuff that will endure. Just"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"as many varieties of prehistoric animals had to give way to others and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"leave no trace behind them, so man will also have to give way, if he"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"loses that definite faculty which enables him to find the weapons that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are necessary for him to maintain his own existence."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It is not the State as such that brings about a certain definite advance"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in cultural progress. The State can only protect the race that is the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cause of such progress. The State as such may well exist without"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"undergoing any change for hundreds of years, though the cultural"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculties and the general life of the people, which is shaped by these"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculties, may have suffered profound changes by reason of the fact that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the State did not prevent a process of racial mixture from taking place."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The present State, for instance, may continue to exist in a mere"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mechanical form, but the poison of miscegenation permeating the national"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"body brings about a cultural decadence which manifests itself already in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"various symptoms that are of a detrimental character."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Thus the indispensable prerequisite for the existence of a superior"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"quality of human beings is not the State but the race, which is alone"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"capable of producing that higher human quality."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This capacity is always there, though it will lie dormant unless"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"external circumstances awaken it to action. Nations, or rather races,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which are endowed with the faculty of cultural creativeness possess this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculty in a latent form during periods when the external circumstances"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are unfavourable for the time being and therefore do not allow the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculty to express itself effectively. It is therefore outrageously"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unjust to speak of the pre-Christian Germans as barbarians who had no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"civilization. They never have been such. But the severity of the climate"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that prevailed in the northern regions which they inhabited imposed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"conditions of life which hampered a free development of their creative"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"faculties. If they had come to the fairer climate of the South, with no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"previous culture whatsoever, and if they acquired the necessary human"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"material--that is to say, men of an inferior race--to serve them as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"working implements, the cultural faculty dormant in them would have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"splendidly blossomed forth, as happened in the case of the Greeks, for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"example. But this primordial creative faculty in cultural things was not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"solely due to their northern climate. For the Laplanders or the Eskimos"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would not have become creators of a culture if they were transplanted to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the South. No, this wonderful creative faculty is a special gift"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"bestowed on the Aryan, whether it lies dormant in him or becomes active,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"according as the adverse conditions of nature prevent the active"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"expression of that faculty or favourable circumstances permit it."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"From these facts the following conclusions may be drawn:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The State is only a means to an end. Its end and its purpose is to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preserve and promote a community of human beings who are physically as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"well as spiritually kindred. Above all, it must preserve the existence"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the race, thereby providing the indispensable condition for the free"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"development of all the forces dormant in this race. A great part of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"these faculties will always have to be employed in the first place to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"maintain the physical existence of the race, and only a small portion"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will be free to work in the field of intellectual progress. But, as a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"matter of fact, the one is always the necessary counterpart of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"other."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Those States which do not serve this purpose have no justification for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their existence. They are monstrosities. The fact that they do exist is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"no more of a justification than the successful raids carried out by a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"band of pirates can be considered a justification of piracy."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"We National Socialists, who are fighting for a new WELTANSCHAUUNG, must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"never take our stand on the famous 'basis of facts', and especially not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"on mistaken facts. If we did so, we should cease to be the protagonists"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of a new and great idea and would become slaves in the service of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fallacy which is dominant to-day. We must make a clear-cut distinction"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"between the vessel and its contents. The State is only the vessel and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the race is what it contains. The vessel can have a meaning only if it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preserves and safeguards the contents. Otherwise it is worthless."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Hence the supreme purpose of the ethnical State is to guard and preserve"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those racial elements which, through their work in the cultural field,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"create that beauty and dignity which are characteristic of a higher"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mankind. As Aryans, we can consider the State only as the living"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"organism of a people, an organism which does not merely maintain the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"existence of a people, but functions in such a way as to lead its people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to a position of supreme liberty by the progressive development of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual and cultural faculties."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"What they want to impose upon us as a State to-day is in most cases"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nothing but a monstrosity, the product of a profound human aberration"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which brings untold suffering in its train."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"We National Socialists know that in holding these views we take up a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"revolutionary stand in the world of to-day and that we are branded as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"revolutionaries. But our views and our conduct will not be determined by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the approbation or disapprobation of our contemporaries, but only by our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"duty to follow a truth which we have acknowledged. In doing this we have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"reason to believe that posterity will have a clearer insight, and will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not only understand the work we are doing to-day, but will also ratify"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it as the right work and will exalt it accordingly."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"On these principles we National Socialists base our standards of value"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in appraising a State. This value will be relative when viewed from the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"particular standpoint of the individual nation, but it will be absolute"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"when considered from the standpoint of humanity as a whole. In other"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"words, this means:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"That the excellence of a State can never be judged by the level of its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"culture or the degree of importance which the outside world attaches to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its power, but that its excellence must be judged by the degree to which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its institutions serve the racial stock which belongs to it."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A State may be considered as a model example if it adequately serves not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"only the vital needs of the racial stock it represents but if it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"actually assures by its own existence the preservation of this same"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"racial stock, no matter what general cultural significance this statal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"institution may have in the eyes of the rest of the world. For it is not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the task of the State to create human capabilities, but only to assure"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"free scope for the exercise of capabilities that already exist. On the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"other hand, a State may be called bad if, in spite of the existence of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"high cultural level, it dooms to destruction the bearers of that culture"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"by breaking up their racial uniformity. For the practical effect of such"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a policy would be to destroy those conditions that are indispensable for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the ulterior existence of that culture, which the State did not create"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but which is the fruit of the creative power inherent in the racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"stock whose existence is assured by being united in the living organism"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the State. Once again let me emphasize the fact that the State itself"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is not the substance but the form. Therefore, the cultural level is not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the standard by which we can judge the value of the State in which that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people lives. It is evident that a people which is endowed with high"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"creative powers in the cultural sphere is of more worth than a tribe of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"negroes. And yet the statal organization of the former, if judged from"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the standpoint of efficiency, may be worse than that of the negroes. Not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"even the best of States and statal institutions can evolve faculties"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"from a people which they lack and which they never possessed, but a bad"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State may gradually destroy the faculties which once existed. This it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can do by allowing or favouring the suppression of those who are the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"bearers of a racial culture."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore, the worth of a State can be determined only by asking how far"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it actually succeeds in promoting the well-being of a definite race and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not by the role which it plays in the world at large. Its relative worth"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can be estimated readily and accurately; but it is difficult to judge"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its absolute worth, because the latter is conditioned not only by the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State but also by the quality and cultural level of the people that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"belong to the individual State in question."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore, when we speak of the high mission of the State we must not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"forget that the high mission belongs to the people and that the business"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the State is to use its organizing powers for the purpose of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"furnishing the necessary conditions which allow this people freely to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unfold its creative faculties. And if we ask what kind of statal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"institution we Germans need, we must first have a clear notion as to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people which that State must embrace and what purpose it must serve."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Unfortunately the German national being is not based on a uniform racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"type. The process of welding the original elements together has not gone"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"so far as to warrant us in saying that a new race has emerged. On the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"contrary, the poison which has invaded the national body, especially"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"since the Thirty Years' War, has destroyed the uniform constitution not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"only of our blood but also of our national soul. The open frontiers of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"our native country, the association with non-German foreign elements in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the territories that lie all along those frontiers, and especially the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"strong influx of foreign blood into the interior of the REICH itself,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has prevented any complete assimilation of those various elements,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because the influx has continued steadily. Out of this melting-pot no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"new race arose. The heterogeneous elements continue to exist side by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"side. And the result is that, especially in times of crisis, when the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"herd usually flocks together, the Germans disperse in all directions."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The fundamental racial elements are not only different in different"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"districts, but there are also various elements in the single districts."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Beside the Nordic type we find the East-European type, beside the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Eastern there is the Dinaric, the Western type intermingling with both,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and hybrids among them all. That is a grave drawback for us. Through it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the Germans lack that strong herd instinct which arises from unity of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"blood and saves nations from ruin in dangerous and critical times;"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because on such occasions small differences disappear, so that a united"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"herd faces the enemy. What we understand by the word hyper-individualism"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"arises from the fact that our primordial racial elements have existed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"side by side without ever consolidating. During times of peace such a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"situation may offer some advantages, but, taken all in all, it has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"prevented us from gaining a mastery in the world. If in its historical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"development the German people had possessed the unity of herd instinct"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"by which other peoples have so much benefited, then the German REICH"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would probably be mistress of the globe to-day. World history would have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"taken another course and in this case no man can tell if what many"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"blinded pacifists hope to attain by petitioning, whining and crying, may"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not have been reached in this way: namely, a peace which would not be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"based upon the waving of olive branches and tearful misery-mongering of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"pacifist old women, but a peace that would be guaranteed by the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"triumphant sword of a people endowed with the power to master the world"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and administer it in the service of a higher civilization."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The fact that our people did not have a national being based on a unity"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of blood has been the source of untold misery for us. To many petty"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"German potentates it gave residential capital cities, but the German"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people as a whole was deprived of its right to rulership."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Even to-day our nation still suffers from this lack of inner unity; but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"what has been the cause of our past and present misfortunes may turn out"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a blessing for us in the future. Though on the one hand it may be a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"drawback that our racial elements were not welded together, so that no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"homogeneous national body could develop, on the other hand, it was"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fortunate that, since at least a part of our best blood was thus kept"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"pure, its racial quality was not debased."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A complete assimilation of all our racial elements would certainly have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"brought about a homogeneous national organism; but, as has been proved"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the case of every racial mixture, it would have been less capable of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"creating a civilization than by keeping intact its best original"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"elements. A benefit which results from the fact that there was no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"all-round assimilation is to be seen in that even now we have large"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"groups of German Nordic people within our national organization, and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that their blood has not been mixed with the blood of other races. We"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must look upon this as our most valuable treasure for the sake of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"future. During that dark period of absolute ignorance in regard to all"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"racial laws, when each individual was considered to be on a par with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"every other, there could be no clear appreciation of the difference"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"between the various fundamental racial characteristics. We know to-day"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that a complete assimilation of all the various elements which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"constitute the national being might have resulted in giving us a larger"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"share of external power: but, on the other hand, the highest of human"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"aims would not have been attained, because the only kind of people which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fate has obviously chosen to bring about this perfection would have been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lost in such a general mixture of races which would constitute such a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"racial amalgamation."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"But what has been prevented by a friendly Destiny, without any"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"assistance on our part, must now be reconsidered and utilized in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"light of our new knowledge."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"He who talks of the German people as having a mission to fulfil on this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"earth must know that this cannot be fulfilled except by the building up"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of a State whose highest purpose is to preserve and promote those nobler"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"elements of our race and of the whole of mankind which have remained"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unimpaired."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Thus for the first time a high inner purpose is accredited to the State."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In face of the ridiculous phrase that the State should do no more than"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"act as the guardian of public order and tranquillity, so that everybody"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can peacefully dupe everybody else, it is given a very high mission"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"indeed to preserve and encourage the highest type of humanity which a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"beneficent Creator has bestowed on this earth. Out of a dead mechanism"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which claims to be an end in itself a living organism shall arise which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has to serve one purpose exclusively: and that, indeed, a purpose which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"belongs to a higher order of ideas."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"As a State the German REICH shall include all Germans. Its task is not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"only to gather in and foster the most valuable sections of our people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but to lead them slowly and surely to a dominant position in the world."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Thus a period of stagnation is superseded by a period of effort. And"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"here, as in every other sphere, the proverb holds good that to rest is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to rust; and furthermore the proverb that victory will always be won by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"the less it be understood at the time by the broad masses, the more"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"magnificent will be its success. That is what the lesson of history"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teaches. And the achievement will be all the more significant if the end"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is conceived in the right way and the fight carried through with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unswerving persistence. Many of the officials who direct the affairs of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"comfortable to look upon the State as a mechanism, whose purpose is its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"own preservation, and to say that 'their lives belong to the State,' as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"if anything that grew from the inner life of the nation can logically"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"serve anything but the national being, and as if man could be made for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"anything else than for his fellow beings. Naturally, it is easier, as I"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have said, to consider the authority of the State as nothing but the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"formal mechanism of an organization, rather than as the sovereign"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"incarnation of a people's instinct for self-preservation on this earth."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For these weak minds the State and the authority of the State is nothing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but an aim in itself, while for us it is an effective weapon in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"service of the great and eternal struggle for existence, a weapon which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"everyone must adopt, not because it is a mere formal mechanism, but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because it is the main expression of our common will to exist."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore, in the fight for our new idea, which conforms completely to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the primal meaning of life, we shall find only a small number of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"comrades in a social order which has become decrepit not only physically"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but mentally also. From these strata of our population only a few"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"exceptional people will join our ranks, only those few old people whose"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"hearts have remained young and whose courage is still vigorous, but not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those who consider it their duty to maintain the state of affairs that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"exists."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Against us we have the innumerable army of all those who are lazy-minded"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and indifferent rather than evil, and those whose self-interest leads"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"them to uphold the present state of affairs. On the apparent"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"hopelessness of our great struggle is based the magnitude of our task"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and the possibilities of success. A battle-cry which from the very start"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will scare off all the petty spirits, or at least discourage them, will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"become the signal for a rally of all those temperaments that are of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"real fighting metal. And it must be clearly recognized that if a highly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"energetic and active body of men emerge from a nation and unite in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"of our victory. Just because our task is so great and because so many"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"difficulties have to be overcome, the highest probability is that only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the best kind of protagonists will join our ranks. This selection is the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"guarantee of our success. Nature generally takes certain measures to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"correct the effect which racial mixture produces in life. She is not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"much in favour of the mongrel. The later products of cross-breeding have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to suffer bitterly, especially the third, fourth and fifth generations."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Not only are they deprived of the higher qualities that belonged to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"parents who participated in the first mixture, but they also lack"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"definite will-power and vigorous vital energies owing to the lack of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"harmony in the quality of their blood. At all critical moments in which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a person of pure racial blood makes correct decisions, that is to say,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"decisions that are coherent and uniform, the person of mixed blood will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"become confused and take measures that are incoherent. Hence we see that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a person of mixed blood is not only relatively inferior to a person of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"pure blood, but is also doomed to become extinct more rapidly. In"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"innumerable cases wherein the pure race holds its ground the mongrel"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"breaks down. Therein we witness the corrective provision which Nature"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"adopts. She restricts the possibilities of procreation, thus impeding"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the fertility of cross-breeds and bringing them to extinction."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For instance, if an individual member of a race should mingle his blood"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with the member of a superior race the first result would be a lowering"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the racial level, and furthermore the descendants of this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cross-breeding would be weaker than those of the people around them who"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"had maintained their blood unadulterated. Where no new blood from the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"superior race enters the racial stream of the mongrels, and where those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mongrels continue to cross-breed among themselves, the latter will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"either die out because they have insufficient powers of resistance,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which is Nature's wise provision, or in the course of many thousands of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"years they will form a new mongrel race in which the original elements"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will become so wholly mixed through this millennial crossing that traces"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the original elements will be no longer recognizable. And thus a new"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people would be developed which possessed a certain resistance capacity"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the herd type, but its intellectual value and its cultural"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"significance would be essentially inferior to those which the first"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cross-breeds possessed. But even in this last case the mongrel product"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would succumb in the mutual struggle for existence with a higher racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"group that had maintained its blood unmixed. The herd solidarity which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this mongrel race had developed through thousands of years will not be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"equal to the struggle. And this is because it would lack elasticity and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"constructive capacity to prevail over a race of homogeneous blood that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"was mentally and culturally superior."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therewith we may lay down the following principle as valid: every racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mixture leads, of necessity, sooner or later to the downfall of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mongrel product, provided the higher racial strata of this cross-breed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has not retained within itself some sort of racial homogeneity. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"danger to the mongrels ceases only when this higher stratum, which has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"maintained certain standards of homogeneous breeding, ceases to be true"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to its pedigree and intermingles with the mongrels."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This principle is the source of a slow but constant regeneration whereby"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"all the poison which has invaded the racial body is gradually eliminated"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"so long as there still remains a fundamental stock of pure racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"elements which resists further crossbreeding."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Such a process may set in automatically among those people where a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"strong racial instinct has remained. Among such people we may count"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those elements which, for some particular cause such as coercion, have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"been thrown out of the normal way of reproduction along strict racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lines. As soon as this compulsion ceases, that part of the race which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has remained intact will tend to marry with its own kind and thus impede"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"further intermingling. Then the mongrels recede quite naturally into the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"background unless their numbers had increased so much as to be able to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"withstand all serious resistance from those elements which had preserved"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the purity of their race."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"When men have lost their natural instincts and ignore the obligations"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"imposed on them by Nature, then there is no hope that Nature will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"correct the loss that has been caused, until recognition of the lost"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instincts has been restored. Then the task of bringing back what has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"been lost will have to be accomplished. But there is serious danger that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those who have become blind once in this respect will continue more and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"more to break down racial barriers and finally lose the last remnants of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"what is best in them. What then remains is nothing but a uniform"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mish-mash, which seems to be the dream of our fine Utopians. But that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mish-mash would soon banish all ideals from the world. Certainly a great"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"herd could thus be formed. One can breed a herd of animals; but from a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mixture of this kind men such as have created and founded civilizations"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would not be produced. The mission of humanity might then be considered"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"at an end."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Those who do not wish that the earth should fall into such a condition"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must realize that it is the task of the German State in particular to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"see to it that the process of bastardization is brought to a stop."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Our contemporary generation of weaklings will naturally decry such a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"policy and whine and complain about it as an encroachment on the most"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"sacred of human rights. But there is only one right that is sacrosanct"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and this right is at the same time a most sacred duty. This right and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"obligation are: that the purity of the racial blood should be guarded,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"so that the best types of human beings may be preserved and that thus we"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"should render possible a more noble development of humanity itself."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A folk-State should in the first place raise matrimony from the level of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"being a constant scandal to the race. The State should consecrate it as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an institution which is called upon to produce creatures made in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"likeness of the Lord and not create monsters that are a mixture of man"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and ape. The protest which is put forward in the name of humanity does"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not fit the mouth of a generation that makes it possible for the most"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"If for a period of only 600 years those individuals would be sterilized"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"who are physically degenerate or mentally diseased, humanity would not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"at least the beginnings of a race from which all those germs would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"eliminated which are to-day the cause of our moral and physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"To achieve this the State should first of all not leave the colonization"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"this way frontier colonies could gradually be founded whose inhabitants"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would be of the purest racial stock, and hence would possess the best"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"qualities of the race. Such colonies would be a valuable asset to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"whole nation. Their development would be a source of joy and confidence"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and pride to each citizen of the nation, because they would contain the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"longer pay exclusive attention to breeding and rearing pedigree dogs and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"horses and cats, but will endeavour to improve the breed of the human"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"hundreds and thousands accept the principle of celibacy from their own"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"to make this sacrifice if, instead of such a precept, they were simply"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"told that they ought to put an end to this truly original sin of racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"corruption which is steadily being passed on from one generation to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

fine thing, but the pity is that it cannot be carried out. And we"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

of such an idea. You know only one anxiety and that is for your own
personal existence. You have one God, and that is your money. We do not
turn to you, however, for help, but to the great army of those who are
too poor to consider their personal existence as the highest good on
earth. They do not place their trust in money but in other gods, into
whose hands they confide their lives. Above all we turn to the vast army
of our German youth. They are coming to maturity in a great epoch, and
they will fight against the evils which were due to the laziness and
indifference of their fathers. Either the German youth will one day"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"to remedy the situation, then such a generation is doomed to disaster. A"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"marked characteristic of our bourgeois world is that they no longer can"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"deny the evil conditions that exist. They have to admit that there is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"much which is foul and wrong; but they are not able to make up their"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"minds to fight against that evil, which would mean putting forth the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"energy to mobilize the forces of 60 or 70 million people and thus oppose"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this menace. They do just the opposite. When such an effort is made"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"elsewhere they only indulge in silly comment and try from a safe"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"distance to show that such an enterprise is theoretically impossible and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"Just as, in general, the racial quality is the preliminary condition for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"succumbed because he lacked learning. Those who fail are they who try to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"Moltke's saying, that in the long run fortune favours only the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"protected by the State. As regards purely formal education the State"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"even now interferes with the individual's right of self-determination"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and insists upon the right of the community by submitting the child to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an obligatory system of training, without paying attention to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"approval or disapproval of the parents. In a similar way and to a higher"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"hardened for the demands to be made on them in later years. Above all,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"The work of education and hygiene has to begin with the young mother."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The painstaking efforts carried on for several decades have succeeded in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"material of which, as experience shows, they retain only a small part,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and mostly not the essentials, but only the secondary and useless"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"portion; because the young mind is incapable of sifting the right kind"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of learning out of all the stuff that is pumped into it. To-day, even in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the curriculum of the high schools, only two short hours in the week are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"reserved for gymnastics; and worse still, it is left to the pupils to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"decide whether or not they want to take part. This shows a grave"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"disproportion between this branch of education and purely intellectual"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instruction. Not a single day should be allowed to pass in which the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"young pupil does not have one hour of physical training in the morning"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and one in the evening; and every kind of sport and gymnastics should be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"included. There is one kind of sport which should be specially"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"encouraged, although many people who call themselves VÖLKISCH consider"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it brutal and vulgar, and that is boxing. It is incredible how many"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"false notions prevail among the 'cultivated' classes. The fact that the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"young man learns how to fence and then spends his time in duels is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"considered quite natural and respectable. But boxing--that is brutal."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Why? There is no other sport which equals this in developing the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"militant spirit, none that demands such a power of rapid decision or"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which gives the body the flexibility of good steel. It is no more vulgar"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"when two young people settle their differences with their fists than"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with sharp-pointed pieces of steel. One who is attacked and defends"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"himself with his fists surely does not act less manly than one who runs"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"off and yells for the assistance of a policeman. But, above all, a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"healthy youth has to learn to endure hard knocks. This principle may"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"appear savage to our contemporary champions who fight only with the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"weapons of the intellect. But it is not the purpose of the People's"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State to educate a colony of aesthetic pacifists and physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"degenerates. This State does not consider that the human ideal is to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"found in the honourable philistine or the maidenly spinster, but in a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"dareful personification of manly force and in women capable of bringing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"men into the world."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Generally speaking, the function of sport is not only to make the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"individual strong, alert and daring, but also to harden the body and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"train it to endure an adverse environment."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"If our superior class had not received such a distinguished education,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and if, on the contrary, they had learned boxing, it would never have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"been possible for bullies and deserters and other such CANAILLE to carry"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"through a German revolution. For the success of this revolution was not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"due to the courageous, energetic and audacious activities of its authors"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but to the lamentable cowardice and irresolution of those who ruled the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"German State at that time and were responsible for it. But our educated"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"leaders had received only an 'intellectual' training and thus found"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"themselves defenceless when their adversaries used iron bars instead of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual weapons. All this could happen only because our superior"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"scholastic system did not train men to be real men but merely to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"civil servants, engineers, technicians, chemists, litterateurs, jurists"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and, finally, professors; so that intellectualism should not die out."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Our leadership in the purely intellectual sphere has always been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"brilliant, but as regards will-power in practical affairs our leadership"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has been beneath criticism."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Of course education cannot make a courageous man out of one who is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"temperamentally a coward. But a man who naturally possesses a certain"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"degree of courage will not be able to develop that quality if his"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"defective education has made him inferior to others from the very start"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"as regards physical strength and prowess. The army offers the best"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"example of the fact that the knowledge of one's physical ability"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"develops a man's courage and militant spirit. Outstanding heroes are not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the rule in the army, but the average represents men of high courage."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The excellent schooling which the German soldiers received before the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"War imbued the members of the whole gigantic organism with a degree of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"confidence in their own superiority such as even our opponents never"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"thought possible. All the immortal examples of dauntless courage and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"daring which the German armies gave during the late summer and autumn of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"1914, as they advanced from triumph to triumph, were the result of that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"education which had been pursued systematically. During those long years"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of peace before the last War men who were almost physical weaklings were"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"made capable of incredible deeds, and thus a self-confidence was"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"developed which did not fail even in the most terrible battles."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It is our German people, which broke down and were delivered over to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"kicked by the rest of the world, that had need of the power that comes"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"by suggestion from self-confidence. But this confidence in one's self"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must be instilled into our children from their very early years. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"whole system of education and training must be directed towards"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fostering in the child the conviction that he is unquestionably a match"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for any- and everybody. The individual has to regain his own physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"strength and prowess in order to believe in the invincibility of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nation to which he belongs. What has formerly led the German armies to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"victory was the sum total of the confidence which each individual had in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"himself, and which all of them had in those who held the positions of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"command. What will restore the national strength of the German people is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the conviction that they will be able to reconquer their liberty. But"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this conviction can only be the final product of an equal feeling in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"millions of individuals. And here again we must have no illusions."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The collapse of our people was overwhelming, and the efforts to put an"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"end to so much misery must also be overwhelming. It would be a bitter"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and grave error to believe that our people could be made strong again"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"simply by means of our present bourgeois training in good order and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"obedience. That will not suffice if we are to break up the present order"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of things, which now sanctions the acknowledgment of our defeat and cast"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the broken chains of our slavery in the face of our opponents. Only by a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"superabundance of national energy and a passionate thirst for liberty"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can we recover what has been lost."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Also the manner of clothing the young should be such as harmonizes with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this purpose. It is really lamentable to see how our young people have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fallen victims to a fashion mania which perverts the meaning of the old"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"adage that clothes make the man."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Especially in regard to young people clothes should take their place in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the service of education. The boy who walks about in summer-time wearing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"long baggy trousers and clad up to the neck is hampered even by his"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"clothes in feeling any inclination towards strenuous physical exercise."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Ambition and, to speak quite frankly, even vanity must be appealed to. I"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"do not mean such vanity as leads people to want to wear fine clothes,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which not everybody can afford, but rather the vanity which inclines a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"person towards developing a fine bodily physique. And this is something"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which everybody can help to do."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This will come in useful also for later years. The young girl must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"become acquainted with her sweetheart. If the beauty of the body were"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not completely forced into the background to-day through our stupid"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"manner of dressing, it would not be possible for thousands of our girls"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to be led astray by Jewish mongrels, with their repulsive crooked"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"waddle. It is also in the interests of the nation that those who have a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"beautiful physique should be brought into the foreground, so that they"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"might encourage the development of a beautiful bodily form among the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people in general."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Military training is excluded among us to-day, and therewith the only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"institution which in peace-times at least partly made up for the lack of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"physical training in our education. Therefore what I have suggested is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"all the more necessary in our time. The success of our old military"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"training not only showed itself in the education of the individual but"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"also in the influence which it exercised over the mutual relationship"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"between the sexes. The young girl preferred the soldier to one who was"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not a soldier. The People's State must not confine its control of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"physical training to the official school period, but it must demand"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that, after leaving school and while the adolescent body is still"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"developing, the boy continues this training. For on such proper physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"development success in after-life largely depends. It is stupid to think"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that the right of the State to supervise the education of its young"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"citizens suddenly comes to an end the moment they leave school and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"recommences only with military service. This right is a duty, and as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"such it must continue uninterruptedly. The present State, which does not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"interest itself in developing healthy men, has criminally neglected this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"duty. It leaves our contemporary youth to be corrupted on the streets"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and in the brothels, instead of keeping hold of the reins and continuing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the physical training of these youths up to the time when they are grown"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"into healthy young men and women."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For the present it is a matter of indifference what form the State"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"chooses for carrying on this training. The essential matter is that it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"should be developed and that the most suitable ways of doing so should"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be investigated. The People's State will have to consider the physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"training of the youth after the school period just as much a public duty"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"as their intellectual training; and this training will have to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"carried out through public institutions. Its general lines can be a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preparation for subsequent service in the army. And then it will no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"longer be the task of the army to teach the young recruit the most"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"elementary drill regulations. In fact the army will no longer have to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"deal with recruits in the present sense of the word, but it will rather"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have to transform into a soldier the youth whose bodily prowess has been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"already fully trained."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In the People's State the army will no longer be obliged to teach boys"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"how to walk and stand erect, but it will be the final and supreme school"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of patriotic education. In the army the young recruit will learn the art"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of bearing arms, but at the same time he will be equipped for his other"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"duties in later life. And the supreme aim of military education must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"always be to achieve that which was attributed to the old army as its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"highest merit: namely, that through his military schooling the boy must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be transformed into a man, that he must not only learn to obey but also"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"acquire the fundamentals that will enable him one day to command. He"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must learn to remain silent not only when he is rightly rebuked but also"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"when he is wrongly rebuked."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Furthermore, on the self-consciousness of his own strength and on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"basis of that ESPRIT DE CORPS which inspires him and his comrades, he"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must become convinced that he belongs to a people who are invincible."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"After he has completed his military training two certificates shall be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"handed to the soldier. The one will be his diploma as a citizen of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State, a juridical document which will enable him to take part in public"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"affairs. The second will be an attestation of his physical health, which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"guarantees his fitness for marriage."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The People's State will have to direct the education of girls just as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that of boys and according to the same fundamental principles. Here"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"again special importance must be given to physical training, and only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"after that must the importance of spiritual and mental training be taken"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"into account. In the education of the girl the final goal always to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"kept in mind is that she is one day to be a mother."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It is only in the second place that the People's State must busy itself"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with the training of character, using all the means adapted to that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"purpose."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Of course the essential traits of the individual character are already"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"there fundamentally before any education takes place. A person who is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fundamentally egoistic will always remain fundamentally egoistic, and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the idealist will always remain fundamentally an idealist. Besides"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those, however, who already possess a definite stamp of character there"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are millions of people with characters that are indefinite and vague."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The born delinquent will always remain a delinquent, but numerous people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"who show only a certain tendency to commit criminal acts may become"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"useful members of the community if rightly trained; whereas, on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"other hand, weak and unstable characters may easily become evil elements"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"if the system of education has been bad."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"During the War it was often lamented that our people could be so little"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"reticent. This failing made it very difficult to keep even highly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"important secrets from the knowledge of the enemy. But let us ask this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"question: What did the German educational system do in pre-War times to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teach the Germans to be discreet? Did it not very often happen in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"schooldays that the little tell-tale was preferred to his companions who"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"kept their mouths shut? Is it not true that then, as well as now,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"complaining about others was considered praiseworthy 'candour', while"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"silent discretion was taken as obstinacy? Has any attempt ever been made"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to teach that discretion is a precious and manly virtue? No, for such"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"matters are trifles in the eyes of our educators. But these trifles cost"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"our State innumerable millions in legal expenses; for 90 per cent of all"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the processes for defamation and such like charges arise only from a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lack of discretion. Remarks that are made without any sense of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"responsibility are thoughtlessly repeated from mouth to mouth; and our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"economic welfare is continually damaged because important methods of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"production are thus disclosed. Secret preparations for our national"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"defence are rendered illusory because our people have never learned the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"duty of silence. They repeat everything they happen to hear. In times of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"war such talkative habits may even cause the loss of battles and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"therefore may contribute essentially to the unsuccessful outcome of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"campaign. Here, as in other matters, we may rest assured that adults"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cannot do what they have not learnt to do in youth. A teacher must not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"try to discover the wild tricks of the boys by encouraging the evil"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"practice of tale-bearing. Young people form a sort of State among"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"themselves and face adults with a certain solidarity. That is quite"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"natural. The ties which unite the ten-year boys to one another are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"stronger and more natural than their relationship to adults. A boy who"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"tells on his comrades commits an act of treason and shows a bent of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"character which is, to speak bluntly, similar to that of a man who"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"commits high treason. Such a boy must not be classed as 'good',"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"'reliable', and so on, but rather as one with undesirable traits of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"character. It may be rather convenient for the teacher to make use of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"such unworthy tendencies in order to help his own work, but by such an"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"attitude the germ of a moral habit is sown in young hearts and may one"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"day show fatal consequences. It has happened more often than once that a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"young informer developed into a big scoundrel."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This is only one example among many. The deliberate training of fine and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"noble traits of character in our schools to-day is almost negative. In"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the future much more emphasis will have to be laid on this side of our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"educational work. Loyalty, self-sacrifice and discretion are virtues"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which a great nation must possess. And the teaching and development of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"to teach the child at an early age to endure pain and injury without"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"complaining we cannot be surprised if at a later age, when the boy has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"grown to be the man and is, for example, in the trenches, the postal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"service is used for nothing else than to send home letters of weeping"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and complaint. If our youths, during their years in the primary schools,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"had had their minds crammed with a little less knowledge, and if instead"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"they had been better taught how to be masters of themselves, it would"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have served us well during the years 1914-1918."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In its educational system the People's State will have to attach the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"highest importance to the development of character, hand-in-hand with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"physical training. Many more defects which our national organism shows"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"at present could be at least ameliorated, if not completely eliminated,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"by education of the right kind."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Extreme importance should be attached to the training of will-power and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the habit of making firm decisions, also the habit of being always ready"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to accept responsibilities."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In the training of our old army the principle was in vogue that any"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"order is always better than no order. Applied to our youth this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"principle ought to take the form that any answer is better than no"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"answer. The fear of replying, because one fears to be wrong, ought to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"considered more humiliating than giving the wrong reply. On this simple"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and primitive basis our youth should be trained to have the courage to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"act."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It has been often lamented that in November and December 1918 all the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"authorities lost their heads and that, from the monarch down to the last"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"divisional commander, nobody had sufficient mettle to make a decision on"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"his own responsibility. That terrible fact constitutes a grave rebuke to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"our educational system; because what was then revealed on a colossal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"scale at that moment of catastrophe was only what happens on a smaller"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"scale everywhere among us. It is the lack of will-power, and not the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lack of arms, which renders us incapable of offering any serious"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"resistance to-day. This defect is found everywhere among our people and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"prevents decisive action wherever risks have to be taken, as if any"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"great action can be taken without also taking the risk. Quite"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unsuspectingly, a German General found a formula for this lamentable"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lack of the will-to-act when he said: I act only when I can count on a
51 per cent probability of success. In that '51 per cent probability'"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"we find the very root of the German collapse. The man who demands from"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Fate a guarantee of his success deliberately denies the significance of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an heroic act. For this significance consists in the very fact that, in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the definite knowledge that the situation in question is fraught with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mortal danger, an action is undertaken which may lead to success. A"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"patient suffering from cancer and who knows that his death is certain if"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"he does not undergo an operation, needs no 51 per cent probability of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cure before facing the operation. And if the operation promises only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"half of one per cent probability of success a man of courage will risk"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it and would not whine if it turned out unsuccessful."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"All in all, the cowardly lack of will-power and the incapacity for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"making decisions are chiefly results of the erroneous education given us"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in our youth. The disastrous effects of this are now widespread among"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"us. The crowning examples of that tragic chain of consequences are shown"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the lack of civil courage which our leading statesmen display."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The cowardice which leads nowadays to the shirking of every kind of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"responsibility springs from the same roots. Here again it is the fault"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the education given our young people. This drawback permeates all"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"sections of public life and finds its immortal consummation in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"institutions of government that function under the parliamentary regime."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Already in the school, unfortunately, more value is placed on"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"'confession and full repentance' and 'contrite renouncement', on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"part of little sinners, than on a simple and frank avowal. But this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"latter seems to-day, in the eyes of many an educator, to savour of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"spirit of utter incorrigibility and depravation. And, though it may seem"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"incredible, many a boy is told that the gallows tree is waiting for him"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because he has shown certain traits which might be of inestimable value"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the nation as a whole."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Just as the People's State must one day give its attention to training"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the will-power and capacity for decision among the youth, so too it must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"inculcate in the hearts of the young generation from early childhood"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"onwards a readiness to accept responsibilities, and the courage of open"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and frank avowal. If it recognizes the full significance of this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"necessity, finally--after a century of educative work--it will succeed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in building up a nation which will no longer be subject to those defeats"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that have contributed so disastrously to bring about our present"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"overthrow."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The formal imparting of knowledge, which constitutes the chief work of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"our educational system to-day, will be taken over by the People's State"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with only few modifications. These modifications must be made in three"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"branches."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"First of all, the brains of the young people must not generally be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"burdened with subjects of which ninety-five per cent are useless to them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and are therefore forgotten again. The curriculum of the primary and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"secondary schools presents an odd mixture at the present time. In many"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"branches of study the subject matter to be learned has become so"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"enormous that only a very small fraction of it can be remembered later"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"on, and indeed only a very small fraction of this whole mass of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"knowledge can be used. On the other hand, what is learned is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"insufficient for anybody who wishes to specialize in any certain branch"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for the purpose of earning his daily bread. Take, for example, the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"average civil servant who has passed through the GYMNASIUM or High"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"School, and ask him at the age of thirty or forty how much he has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"retained of the knowledge that was crammed into him with so much pains."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"How much is retained from all that was stuffed into his brain? He will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"certainly answer: Well, if a mass of stuff was then taught, it was not
for the sole purpose of supplying the student with a great stock of
knowledge from which he could draw in later years, but it served to
develop the understanding, the memory, and above all it helped to
strengthen the thinking powers of the brain. That is partly true. And"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"yet it is somewhat dangerous to submerge a young brain in a flood of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"impressions which it can hardly master and the single elements of which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it cannot discern or appreciate at their just value. It is mostly the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"essential part of this knowledge, and not the accidental, that is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"forgotten and sacrificed. Thus the principal purpose of this copious"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instruction is frustrated, for that purpose cannot be to make the brain"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"capable of learning by simply offering it an enormous and varied amount"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of subjects for acquisition, but rather to furnish the individual with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that stock of knowledge which he will need in later life and which he"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can use for the good of the community. This aim, however, is rendered"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"illusory if, because of the superabundance of subjects that have been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"crammed into his head in childhood, a person is able to remember"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nothing, or at least not the essential portion, of all this in later"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"life. There is no reason why millions of people should learn two or"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"three languages during the school years, when only a very small fraction"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will have the opportunity to use these languages in later life and when"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"most of them will therefore forget those languages completely. To take"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an instance: Out of 100,000 students who learn French there are probably"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not 2,000 who will be in a position to make use of this accomplishment"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in later life, while 98,000 will never have a chance to utilize in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"practice what they have learned in youth. They have spent thousands of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"hours on a subject which will afterwards be without any value or"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"importance to them. The argument that these matters form part of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"general process of educating the mind is invalid. It would be sound if"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"all these people were able to use this learning in after life. But, as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the situation stands, 98,000 are tortured to no purpose and waste their"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"valuable time, only for the sake of the 2,000 to whom the language will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be of any use."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In the case of that language which I have chosen as an example it cannot"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be said that the learning of it educates the student in logical thinking"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"or sharpens his mental acumen, as the learning of Latin, for instance,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"might be said to do. It would therefore be much better to teach young"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"students only the general outline, or, better, the inner structure of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"such a language: that is to say, to allow them to discern the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"characteristic features of the language, or perhaps to make them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"acquainted with the rudiments of its grammar, its pronunciation, its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"syntax, style, etc. That would be sufficient for average students,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because it would provide a clearer view of the whole and could be more"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"easily remembered. And it would be more practical than the present-day"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"attempt to cram into their heads a detailed knowledge of the whole"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"language, which they can never master and which they will readily"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"forget. If this method were adopted, then we should avoid the danger"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that, out of the superabundance of matter taught, only some fragments"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will remain in the memory; for the youth would then have to learn what"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is worth while, and the selection between the useful and the useless"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would thus have been made beforehand."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"As regards the majority of students the knowledge and understanding of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the rudiments of a language would be quite sufficient for the rest of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their lives. And those who really do need this language subsequently"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would thus have a foundation on which to start, should they choose to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"make a more thorough study of it."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"By adopting such a curriculum the necessary amount of time would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"gained for physical exercises as well as for a more intense training in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the various educational fields that have already been mentioned."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A reform of particular importance is that which ought to take place in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the present methods of teaching history. Scarcely any other people are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"made to study as much of history as the Germans, and scarcely any other"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people make such a bad use of their historical knowledge. If politics"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"means history in the making, then our way of teaching history stands"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"condemned by the way we have conducted our politics. But there would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"no point in bewailing the lamentable results of our political conduct"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"unless one is now determined to give our people a better political"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"education. In 99 out of 100 cases the results of our present teaching of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"history are deplorable. Usually only a few dates, years of birth and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"names, remain in the memory, while a knowledge of the main and clearly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"defined lines of historical development is completely lacking. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"essential features which are of real significance are not taught. It is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"left to the more or less bright intelligence of the individual to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"discover the inner motivating urge amid the mass of dates and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"chronological succession of events."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"You may object as strongly as you like to this unpleasant statement. But"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"read with attention the speeches which our parliamentarians make during"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"one session alone on political problems and on questions of foreign"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"policy in particular. Remember that those gentlemen are, or claim to be,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the elite of the German nation and that at least a great number of them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have sat on the benches of our secondary schools and that many of them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have passed through our universities. Then you will realize how"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"defective the historical education of these people has been. If these"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"gentlemen had never studied history at all but had possessed a sound"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instinct for public affairs, things would have gone better, and the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nation would have benefited greatly thereby."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The subject matter of our historical teaching must be curtailed. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"chief value of that teaching is to make the principal lines of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"historical development understood. The more our historical teaching is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"limited to this task, the more we may hope that it will turn out"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"subsequently to be of advantage to the individual and, through the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"individual, to the community as a whole. For history must not be studied"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"merely with a view to knowing what happened in the past but as a guide"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for the future, and to teach us what policy would be the best to follow"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for the preservation of our own people. That is the real end; and the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teaching of history is only a means to attain this end. But here again"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the means has superseded the end in our contemporary education. The goal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is completely forgotten. Do not reply that a profound study of history"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"demands a detailed knowledge of all these dates because otherwise we"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"could not fix the great lines of development. That task belongs to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"professional historians. But the average man is not a professor of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"history. For him history has only one mission and that is to provide him"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with such an amount of historical knowledge as is necessary in order to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"enable him to form an independent opinion on the political affairs of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"his own country. The man who wants to become a professor of history can"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"devote himself to all the details later on. Naturally he will have to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"occupy himself even with the smallest details. Of course our present"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teaching of history is not adequate to all this. Its scope is too vast"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for the average student and too limited for the student who wishes to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an historical expert."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Finally, it is the business of the People's State to arrange for the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"writing of a world history in which the race problem will occupy a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"dominant position."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"To sum up: The People's State must reconstruct our system of general"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instruction in such a way that it will embrace only what is essential."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Beyond this it will have to make provision for a more advanced teaching"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the various subjects for those who want to specialize in them. It"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will suffice for the average individual to be acquainted with the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fundamentals of the various subjects to serve as the basis of what may"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be called an all-round education. He ought to study exhaustively and in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"detail only that subject in which he intends to work during the rest of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"his life. A general instruction in all subjects should be obligatory,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and specialization should be left to the choice of the individual."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In this way the scholastic programme would be shortened, and thus"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"several school hours would be gained which could be utilized for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"physical training and character training, in will-power, the capacity"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for making practical judgments, decisions, etc."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The little account taken by our school training to-day, especially in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the secondary schools, of the callings that have to be followed in after"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"life is demonstrated by the fact that men who are destined for the same"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"calling in life are educated in three different kinds of schools. What"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is of decisive importance is general education only and not the special"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teaching. When special knowledge is needed it cannot be given in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"curriculum of our secondary schools as they stand to-day."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore the People's State will one day have to abolish such"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"half-measures."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The second modification in the curriculum which the People's State will"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have to make is the following:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It is a characteristic of our materialistic epoch that our scientific"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"education shows a growing emphasis on what is real and practical: such"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"subjects, for instance, as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Of course they are necessary in an age that is dominated by industrial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"technology and chemistry, and where everyday life shows at least the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"external manifestations of these. But it is a perilous thing to base the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"general culture of a nation on the knowledge of these subjects. On the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"contrary, that general culture ought always to be directed towards"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ideals. It ought to be founded on the humanist disciplines and should"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"aim at giving only the ground work of further specialized instruction in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the various practical sciences. Otherwise we should sacrifice those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"forces that are more important for the preservation of the nation than"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"any technical knowledge. In the historical department the study of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ancient history should not be omitted. Roman history, along general"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lines, is and will remain the best teacher, not only for our own time"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but also for the future. And the ideal of Hellenic culture should be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preserved for us in all its marvellous beauty. The differences between"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the various peoples should not prevent us from recognizing the community"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of race which unites them on a higher plane. The conflict of our times"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is one that is being waged around great objectives. A civilization is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fighting for its existence. It is a civilization that is the product of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"thousands of years of historical development, and the Greek as well as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the German forms part of it."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A clear-cut division must be made between general culture and the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"special branches. To-day the latter threaten more and more to devote"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"themselves exclusively to the service of Mammon. To counterbalance this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"tendency, general culture should be preserved, at least in its ideal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"forms. The principle should be repeatedly emphasized, that industrial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and technical progress, trade and commerce, can flourish only so long as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a folk community exists whose general system of thought is inspired by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ideals, since that is the preliminary condition for a flourishing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"development of the enterprises I have spoken of. That condition is not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"created by a spirit of materialist egotism but by a spirit of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"self-denial and the joy of giving one's self in the service of others."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The system of education which prevails to-day sees its principal object"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in pumping into young people that knowledge which will help them to make"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their way in life. This principle is expressed in the following terms:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The young man must one day become a useful member of human society. By"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that phrase they mean the ability to gain an honest daily livelihood."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The superficial training in the duties of good citizenship, which he"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"acquires merely as an accidental thing, has very weak foundations. For"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in itself the State represents only a form, and therefore it is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"difficult to train people to look upon this form as the ideal which they"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will have to serve and towards which they must feel responsible. A form"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"can be too easily broken. But, as we have seen, the idea which people"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have of the State to-day does not represent anything clearly defined."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore, there is nothing but the usual stereotyped 'patriotic'"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"training. In the old Germany the greatest emphasis was placed on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"divine right of the small and even the smallest potentates. The way in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which this divine right was formulated and presented was never very"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"clever and often very stupid. Because of the large numbers of those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"small potentates, it was impossible to give adequate biographical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"accounts of the really great personalities that shed their lustre on the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"history of the German people. The result was that the broad masses"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"received a very inadequate knowledge of German history. Here, too, the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"great lines of development were missing."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It is evident that in such a way no real national enthusiasm could be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"aroused. Our educational system proved incapable of selecting from the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"general mass of our historical personages the names of a few"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"personalities which the German people could be proud to look upon as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"their own. Thus the whole nation might have been united by the ties of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"common knowledge of this common heritage. The really important figures"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in German history were not presented to the present generation. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"attention of the whole nation was not concentrated on them for the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"purpose of awakening a common national spirit. From the various subjects"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that were taught, those who had charge of our training seemed incapable"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of selecting what redounded most to the national honour and lifting that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"above the common objective level, in order to inflame the national pride"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the light of such brilliant examples. At that time such a course"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"would have been looked upon as rank chauvinism, which did not then have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a very pleasant savour. Pettifogging dynastic patriotism was more"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"acceptable and more easily tolerated than the glowing fire of a supreme"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"national pride. The former could be always pressed into service, whereas"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the latter might one day become a dominating force. Monarchist"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"patriotism terminated in Associations of Veterans, whereas passionate"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"national patriotism might have opened a road which would be difficult to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"determine. This national passion is like a highly tempered thoroughbred"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"who is discriminate about the sort of rider he will tolerate in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"saddle. No wonder that most people preferred to shirk such a danger."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Nobody seemed to think it possible that one day a war might come which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"artillery bombardment and waves of attacks with poison gas. But when it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"did come our lack of this patriotic passion was avenged in a terrible"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"way. None were very enthusiastic about dying for their imperial and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"royal sovereigns; while on the other hand the 'Nation' was not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"recognized by the greater number of the soldiers."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Since the revolution broke out in Germany and the monarchist patriotism"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"was therefore extinguished, the purpose of teaching history was nothing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"more than to add to the stock of objective knowledge. The present State"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has no use for patriotic enthusiasm; but it will never obtain what it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"really desires. For if dynastic patriotism failed to produce a supreme"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"power of resistance at a time when the principle of nationalism"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"dominated, it will be still less possible to arouse republican"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"enthusiasm. There can be no doubt that the German people would not have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"stood on the field of battle for four and a half years to fight under"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the battle slogan 'For the Republic,' and least of all those who created"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this grand institution."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In reality this Republic has been allowed to exist undisturbed only by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"grace of its readiness and its promise to all and sundry, to pay tribute"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and reparations to the stranger and to put its signature to any kind of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"territorial renunciation. The rest of the world finds it sympathetic,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"just as a weakling is always more pleasing to those who want to bend him"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to their own uses than is a man who is made of harder metal. But the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fact that the enemy likes this form of government is the worst kind of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"condemnation. They love the German Republic and tolerate its existence"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"because no better instrument could be found which would help them to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"keep our people in slavery. It is to this fact alone that this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"magnanimous institution owes its survival. And that is why it can"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"renounce any REAL system of national education and can feel satisfied"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"when the heroes of the REICH banner shout their hurrahs, but in reality"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"these same heroes would scamper away like rabbits if called upon to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"defend that banner with their blood."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The People's State will have to fight for its existence. It will not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"gain or secure this existence by signing documents like that of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Dawes Plan. But for its existence and defence it will need precisely"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those things which our present system believes can be repudiated. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"more worthy its form and its inner national being. the greater will be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the envy and opposition of its adversaries. The best defence will not be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the arms it possesses but in its citizens. Bastions of fortresses"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will not save it, but the living wall of its men and women, filled with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"an ardent love for their country and a passionate spirit of national"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"patriotism."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Therefore the third point which will have to be considered in relation"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to our educational system is the following:"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The People's State must realize that the sciences may also be made a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"means of promoting a spirit of pride in the nation. Not only the history"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the world but the history of civilization as a whole must be taught"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in the light of this principle. An inventor must appear great not only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"as an inventor but also, and even more so, as a member of the nation."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The admiration aroused by the contemplation of a great achievement must"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be transformed into a feeling of pride and satisfaction that a man of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"one's own race has been chosen to accomplish it. But out of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"abundance of great names in German history the greatest will have to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"selected and presented to our young generation in such a way as to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"become solid pillars of strength to support the national spirit."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The subject matter ought to be systematically organized from the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"standpoint of this principle. And the teaching should be so orientated"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that the boy or girl, after leaving school, will not be a semi-pacifist,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a democrat or of something else of that kind, but a whole-hearted"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"German. So that this national feeling be sincere from the very"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"beginning, and not a mere pretence, the following fundamental and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"inflexible principle should be impressed on the young brain while it is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"yet malleable: The man who loves his nation can prove the sincerity of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this sentiment only by being ready to make sacrifices for the nation's"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"welfare. There is no such thing as a national sentiment which is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"directed towards personal interests. And there is no such thing as a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nationalism that embraces only certain classes. Hurrahing proves nothing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and does not confer the right to call oneself national if behind that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"shout there is no sincere preoccupation for the conservation of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nation's well-being. One can be proud of one's people only if there is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"no class left of which one need to be ashamed. When one half of a nation"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is sunk in misery and worn out by hard distress, or even depraved or"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"degenerate, that nation presents such an unattractive picture that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nobody can feel proud to belong to it. It is only when a nation is sound"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"in all its members, physically and morally, that the joy of belonging to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it can properly be intensified to the supreme feeling which we call"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"national pride. But this pride, in its highest form, can be felt only by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"those who know the greatness of their nation."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The spirit of nationalism and a feeling for social justice must be fused"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"into one sentiment in the hearts of the youth. Then a day will come when"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a nation of citizens will arise which will be welded together through a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"common love and a common pride that shall be invincible and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"indestructible for ever."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The dread of chauvinism, which is a symptom of our time, is a sign of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its impotence. Since our epoch not only lacks everything in the nature"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of exuberant energy but even finds such a manifestation disagreeable,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fate will never elect it for the accomplishment of any great deeds. For"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the greatest changes that have taken place on this earth would have been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"inconceivable if they had not been inspired by ardent and even"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"hysterical passions, but only by the bourgeois virtues of peacefulness"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and order."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"One thing is certain: our world is facing a great revolution. The only"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"question is whether the outcome will be propitious for the Aryan portion"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of mankind or whether the everlasting Jew will profit by it."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"By educating the young generation along the right lines, the People's"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State will have to see to it that a generation of mankind is formed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which will be adequate to this supreme combat that will decide the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"destinies of the world."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"That nation will conquer which will be the first to take this road."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The whole organization of education and training which the People's"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State is to build up must take as its crowning task the work of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"instilling into the hearts and brains of the youth entrusted to it the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"racial instinct and understanding of the racial idea. No boy or girl"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"must leave school without having attained a clear insight into the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"meaning of racial purity and the importance of maintaining the racial"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"blood unadulterated. Thus the first indispensable condition for the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"preservation of our race will have been established and thus the future"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"cultural progress of our people will be assured."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"For in the last analysis all physical and mental training would be in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"vain unless it served an entity which is ready and determined to carry"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"on its own existence and maintain its own characteristic qualities."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"If it were otherwise, something would result which we Germans have cause"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to regret already, without perhaps having hitherto recognized the extent"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of the tragic calamity. We should be doomed to remain also in the future"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"only manure for civilization. And that not in the banal sense of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"contemporary bourgeois mind, which sees in a lost fellow member of our"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people only a lost citizen, but in a sense which we should have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"painfully to recognize: namely, that our racial blood would be destined"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to disappear. By continually mixing with other races we might lift them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"from their former lower level of civilization to a higher grade; but we"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ourselves should descend for ever from the heights we had reached."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Finally, from the racial standpoint this training also must find its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"culmination in the military service. The term of military service is to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be a final stage of the normal training which the average German"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"receives."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"While the People's State attaches the greatest importance to physical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and mental training, it has also to consider, and no less importantly,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the task of selecting men for the service of the State itself. This"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"important matter is passed over lightly at the present time. Generally"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the children of parents who are for the time being in higher situations"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"are in their turn considered worthy of a higher education. Here talent"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"plays a subordinate part. But talent can be estimated only relatively."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Though in general culture he may be inferior to the city child, a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"peasant boy may be more talented than the son of a family that has"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"occupied high positions through many generations. But the superior"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"culture of the city child has in itself nothing to do with a greater or"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lesser degree of talent; for this culture has its roots in the more"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"copious mass of impressions which arise from the more varied education"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and the surroundings among which this child lives. If the intelligent"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"son of peasant parents were educated from childhood in similar"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"surroundings his intellectual accomplishments would be quite otherwise."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"In our day there is only one sphere where the family in which a person"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"has been born means less than his innate gifts. That is the sphere of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"art. Here, where a person cannot just 'learn,' but must have innate"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"gifts that later on may undergo a more or less happy development (in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"sense of a wise development of what is already there), money and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"parental property are of no account. This is a good proof that genius is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not necessarily connected with the higher social strata or with wealth."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Not rarely the greatest artists come from poor families. And many a boy"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"from the country village has eventually become a celebrated master."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It does not say much for the mental acumen of our time that advantage is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"not taken of this truth for the sake of our whole intellectual life. The"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"opinion is advanced that this principle, though undoubtedly valid in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"field of art, has not the same validity in regard to what are called the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"applied sciences. It is true that a man can be trained to a certain"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"amount of mechanical dexterity, just as a poodle can be taught"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"incredible tricks by a clever master. But such training does not bring"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the animal to use his intelligence in order to carry out those tricks."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"And the same holds good in regard to man. It is possible to teach men,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"irrespective of talent or no talent, to go through certain scientific"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"exercises, but in such cases the results are quite as inanimate and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mechanical as in the case of the animal. It would even be possible to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"force a person of mediocre intelligence, by means of a severe course of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual drilling, to acquire more than the average amount of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"knowledge; but that knowledge would remain sterile. The result would be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a man who might be a walking dictionary of knowledge but who will fail"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"miserably on every critical occasion in life and at every juncture where"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"vital decisions have to be taken. Such people need to be drilled"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"specially for every new and even most insignificant task and will never"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be capable of contributing in the least to the general progress of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"mankind. Knowledge that is merely drilled into people can at best"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"qualify them to fill government positions under our present regime."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It goes without saying that, among the sum total of individuals who make"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"up a nation, gifted people are always to be found in every sphere of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"life. It is also quite natural that the value of knowledge will be all"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the greater the more vitally the dead mass of learning is animated by"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the innate talent of the individual who possesses it. Creative work in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"this field can be done only through the marriage of knowledge and"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"talent."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"One example will suffice to show how much our contemporary world is at"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fault in this matter. From time to time our illustrated papers publish,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"for the edification of the German philistine, the news that in some"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"quarter or other of the globe, and for the first time in that locality,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a Negro has become a lawyer, a teacher, a pastor, even a grand opera"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"tenor or something else of that kind. While the bourgeois blockhead"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"stares with amazed admiration at the notice that tells him how"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"marvellous are the achievements of our modern educational technique, the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"more cunning Jew sees in this fact a new proof to be utilized for the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"theory with which he wants to infect the public, namely that all men are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"equal. It does not dawn on the murky bourgeois mind that the fact which"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is published for him is a sin against reason itself, that it is an act"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"of criminal insanity to train a being who is only an anthropoid by birth"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"until the pretence can be made that he has been turned into a lawyer;"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"while, on the other hand, millions who belong to the most civilized"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"races have to remain in positions which are unworthy of their cultural"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"level. The bourgeois mind does not realize that it is a sin against the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will of the eternal Creator to allow hundreds of thousands of highly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"gifted people to remain floundering in the swamp of proletarian misery"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"while Hottentots and Zulus are drilled to fill positions in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual professions. For here we have the product only of a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"drilling technique, just as in the case of the performing dog. If the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"same amount of care and effort were applied among intelligent races each"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"individual would become a thousand times more capable in such matters."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This state of affairs would become intolerable if a day should arrive"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"when it no longer refers to exceptional cases. But the situation is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"already intolerable where talent and natural gifts are not taken as"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"decisive factors in qualifying for the right to a higher education. It"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is indeed intolerable to think that year after year hundreds of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"thousands of young people without a single vestige of talent are deemed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"worthy of a higher education, while other hundreds of thousands who"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"possess high natural gifts have to go without any sort of higher"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"schooling at all. The practical loss thus caused to the nation is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"incalculable. If the number of important discoveries which have been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"made in America has grown considerably in recent years one of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"reasons is that the number of gifted persons belonging to the lowest"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"social classes who were given a higher education in that country is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"proportionately much larger than in Europe."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"A stock of knowledge packed into the brain will not suffice for the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"making of discoveries. What counts here is only that knowledge which is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"illuminated by natural talent. But with us at the present time no value"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is placed on such gifts. Only good school reports count."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Here is another educative work that is waiting for the People's State to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"do. It will not be its task to assure a dominant influence to a certain"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"social class already existing, but it will be its duty to attract the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"most competent brains in the total mass of the nation and promote them"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to place and honour. It is not merely the duty of the State to give to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the average child a certain definite education in the primary school,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"but it is also its duty to open the road to talent in the proper"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"direction. And above all, it must open the doors of the higher schools"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"under the State to talent of every sort, no matter in what social class"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it may appear. This is an imperative necessity; for thus alone will it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"be possible to develop a talented body of public leaders from the class"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which represents learning that in itself is only a dead mass."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"There is still another reason why the State should provide for this"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"situation. Our intellectual class, particularly in Germany, is so shut"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"up in itself and fossilized that it lacks living contact with the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"classes beneath it. Two evil consequences result from this: First, the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual class neither understands nor sympathizes with the broad"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"masses. It has been so long cut off from all connection with them that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"it cannot now have the necessary psychological ties that would enable it"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"to understand them. It has become estranged from the people. Secondly,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the intellectual class lacks the necessary will-power; for this faculty"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"is always weaker in cultivated circles, which live in seclusion, than"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"among the primitive masses of the people. God knows we Germans have"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"never been lacking in abundant scientific culture, but we have always"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"had a considerable lack of will-power and the capacity for making"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"decisions. For example, the more 'intellectual' our statesmen have been"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the more lacking they have been, for the most part, in practical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"achievement. Our political preparation and our technical equipment for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the world war were defective, certainly not because the brains governing"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the nation were too little educated, but because the men who directed"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"our public affairs were over-educated, filled to over-flowing with"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"knowledge and intelligence, yet without any sound instinct and simply"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"without energy, or any spirit of daring. It was our nation's tragedy to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"have to fight for its existence under a Chancellor who was a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"dillydallying philosopher. If instead of a Bethmann von Hollweg we had"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"had a rough man of the people as our leader the heroic blood of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"common grenadier would not have been shed in vain. The exaggeratedly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual material out of which our leaders were made proved to be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the best ally of the scoundrels who carried out the November revolution."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"These intellectuals safeguarded the national wealth in a miserly"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fashion, instead of launching it forth and risking it, and thus they set"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the conditions on which the others won success."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Here the Catholic Church presents an instructive example. Clerical"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"celibacy forces the Church to recruit its priests not from their own"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ranks but progressively from the masses of the people. Yet there are not"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"many who recognize the significance of celibacy in this relation. But"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"therein lies the cause of the inexhaustible vigour which characterizes"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that ancient institution. For by thus unceasingly recruiting the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"ecclesiastical dignitaries from the lower classes of the people, the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Church is enabled not only to maintain the contact of instinctive"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"understanding with the masses of the population but also to assure"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"itself of always being able to draw upon that fund of energy which is"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"present in this form only among the popular masses. Hence the surprising"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"youthfulness of that gigantic organism, its mental flexibility and its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"iron will-power."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"It will be the task of the Peoples' State so to organize and administer"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"its educational system that the existing intellectual class will be"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"constantly furnished with a supply of fresh blood from beneath. From the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"bulk of the nation the State must sift out with careful scrutiny those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"persons who are endowed with natural talents and see that they are"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"employed in the service of the community. For neither the State itself"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"nor the various departments of State exist to furnish revenues for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"members of a special class, but to fulfil the tasks allotted to them."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"This will be possible, however, only if the State trains individuals"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"specially for these offices. Such individuals must have the necessary"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"fundamental capabilities and will-power. The principle does not hold"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"true only in regard to the civil service but also in regard to all those"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"who are to take part in the intellectual and moral leadership of the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"people, no matter in what sphere they may be employed. The greatness of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"a people is partly dependent on the condition that it must succeed in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"training the best brains for those branches of the public service for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which they show a special natural aptitude and in placing them in the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"offices where they can do their best work for the good of the community."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"If two nations of equal strength and quality engage in a mutual conflict"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that nation will come out victorious which has entrusted its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"intellectual and moral leadership to its best talents and that nation"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"will go under whose government represents only a common food trough for"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"privileged groups or classes and where the inner talents of its"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"individual members are not availed of."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"Of course such a reform seems impossible in the world as it is to-day."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The objection will at once be raised, that it is too much to expect from"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the favourite son of a highly-placed civil servant, for instance, that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"he shall work with his hands simply because somebody else whose parents"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"belong to the working-class seems more capable for a job in the civil"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"service. That argument may be valid as long as manual work is looked"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"upon in the same way as it is looked upon to-day. Hence the Peoples'"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"State will have to take up an attitude towards the appreciation of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"manual labour which will be fundamentally different from that which now"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"exists. If necessary, it will have to organize a persistent system of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"teaching which will aim at abolishing the present-day stupid habit of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"looking down on physical labour as an occupation to be ashamed of."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"The individual will have to be valued, not by the class of work he does"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"esteemed by their fellow-citizens must not be according to the kind of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"work they do, because that has been more or less assigned to the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"The present epoch is working out its own ruin. It introduces universal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"that can exist. For equality cannot and does not depend on the work a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"Of course the objection will be made that in general it is difficult to"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"differentiate between the material and ideal values of work and that the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"lower prestige which is attached to physical labour is due to the fact"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"that smaller wages are paid for that kind of work. It will be said that"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"the lower wage is in its turn the reason why the manual worker has less"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"chance to participate in the culture of the nation; so that the ideal"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"side of human culture is less open to him because it has nothing to do"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"with his daily activities. It may be added that the reluctance to do"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"physical work is justified by the fact that, on account of the small"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"income, the cultural level of manual labourers must naturally be low,"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"and that this in turn is a justification for the lower estimation in"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"which manual labour is generally held."	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"There is quite a good deal of truth in all this. But that is the very"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"reason why we ought to see that in the future there should not be such a"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"wide difference in the scale of remuneration. Don't say that under such"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"conditions poorer work would be done. It would be the saddest symptom of"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"decadence if finer intellectual work could be obtained only through the"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"
"stimulus of higher payment. If that point of view had ruled the world up"	"CHAPTER XIV   THE STATE"

"they are fundamentally of the same quality."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"mankind."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"The first step which visibly brought mankind away from the animal world"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"was that which led to the first invention. The invention itself owes its"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"origin to the ruses and stratagems which man employed to assist him in"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the struggle with other creatures for his existence and often to provide"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"him with the only means he could adopt to achieve success in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"struggle. Those first very crude inventions cannot be attributed to the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"individual; for the subsequent observer, that is to say the modern"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"observer, recognizes them only as collective phenomena. Certain tricks"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"and skilful tactics which can be observed in use among the animals"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"strike the eye of the observer as established facts which may be seen"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"their primary cause and so he contents himself with calling such"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"phenomena 'instinctive.'"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"In our case this term has no meaning. Because everyone who believes in"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the higher evolution of living organisms must admit that every"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"manifestation of the vital urge and struggle to live must have had a"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"manifested it for the first time. It was then repeated again and again;"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"and the practice of it spread over a widening area, until finally it"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"passed into the subconscience of every member of the species, where it"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"manifested itself as 'instinct.'"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"This is more easily understood and more easy to believe in the case of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"possessed special capabilities."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"There can be no doubt that personality was then the sole factor in all"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"whole of humanity as a matter of course. An exact exemplification of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"this may be found in those fundamental military principles which have"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"now become the basis of all strategy in war. Originally they sprang from"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the brain of a single individual and in the course of many years, maybe"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"even thousands of years, they were accepted all round as a matter of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"course and this gained universal validity."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Man completed his first discovery by making a second. Among other things"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"he learned how to master other living beings and make them serve him in"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"his struggle for existence. And thus began the real inventive activity"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"of mankind, as it is now visible before our eyes. Those material"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"inventions, beginning with the use of stones as weapons, which led to"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the domestication of animals, the production of fire by artificial"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"means, down to the marvellous inventions of our own days, show clearly"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"that an individual was the originator in each case. The nearer we come"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"to our own time and the more important and revolutionary the inventions"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"become, the more clearly do we recognize the truth of that statement."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"All the material inventions which we see around us have been produced by"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"inventions help man to raise himself higher and higher above the animal"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"world and to separate himself from that world in an absolutely definite"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"way. Hence they serve to elevate the human species and continually to"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"promote its progress. And what the most primitive artifice once did for"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"man in his struggle for existence, as he went hunting through the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"primeval forest, that same sort of assistance is rendered him to-day in"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the form of marvellous scientific inventions which help him in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"present day struggle for life and to forge weapons for future struggles."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"In their final consequences all human thought and invention help man in"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"his life-struggle on this planet, even though the so-called practical"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"utility of an invention, a discovery or a profound scientific theory,"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"may not be evident at first sight. Everything contributes to raise man"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"higher and higher above the level of all the other creatures that"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"surround him, thereby strengthening and consolidating his position; so"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"that he develops more and more in every direction as the ruling being on"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"this earth."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Hence all inventions are the result of the creative faculty of the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"individual. And all such individuals, whether they have willed it or"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"not, are the benefactors of mankind, both great and small. Through their"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"work millions and indeed billions of human beings have been provided"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"with means and resources which facilitate their struggle for existence."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Thus at the origin of the material civilization which flourishes to-day"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"we always see individual persons. They supplement one another and one of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"them bases his work on that of the other. The same is true in regard to"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the practical application of those inventions and discoveries. For all"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the various methods of production are in their turn inventions also and"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"consequently dependent on the creative faculty of the individual. Even"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the purely theoretical work, which cannot be measured by a definite rule"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"and is preliminary to all subsequent technical discoveries, is"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"exclusively the product of the individual brain. The broad masses do not"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"invent, nor does the majority organize or think; but always and in every"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"case the individual man, the person."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Accordingly a human community is well organized only when it facilitates"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"to the highest possible degree individual creative forces and utilizes"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"their work for the benefit of the community. The most valuable factor of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"an invention, whether it be in the world of material realities or in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"world of abstract ideas, is the personality of the inventor himself. The"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"first and supreme duty of an organized folk community is to place the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"inventor in a position where he can be of the greatest benefit to all."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Indeed the very purpose of the organization is to put this principle"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"into practice. Only by so doing can it ward off the curse of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"mechanization and remain a living thing. In itself it must personify the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"effort to place men of brains above the multitude and to make the latter"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"obey the former."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Therefore not only does the organization possess no right to prevent men"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"of brains from rising above the multitude but, on the contrary, it must"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"use its organizing powers to enable and promote that ascension as far as"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"it possibly can. It must start out from the principle that the blessings"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"of mankind never came from the masses but from the creative brains of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"individuals, who are therefore the real benefactors of humanity. It is"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"in the interest of all to assure men of creative brains a decisive"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"influence and facilitate their work. This common interest is surely not"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"served by allowing the multitude to rule, for they are not capable of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"thinking nor are they efficient and in no case whatsoever can they be"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"said to be gifted. Only those should rule who have the natural"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"temperament and gifts of leadership."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Such men of brains are selected mainly, as I have already said, through"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the hard struggle for existence itself. In this struggle there are many"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"who break down and collapse and thereby show that they are not called by"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Destiny to fill the highest positions; and only very few are left who"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"can be classed among the elect. In the realm of thought and of artistic"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"creation, and even in the economic field, this same process of selection"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"takes place, although--especially in the economic field--its operation"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"is heavily handicapped. This same principle of selection rules in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"administration of the State and in that department of power which"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"personifies the organized military defence of the nation. The idea of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"personality rules everywhere, the authority of the individual over his"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"subordinates and the responsibility of the individual towards the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"persons who are placed over him. It is only in political life that this"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"very natural principle has been completely excluded. Though all human"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"civilization has resulted exclusively from the creative activity of the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"individual, the principle that it is the mass which counts--through the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"decision of the majority--makes its appearance only in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"administration of the national community especially in the higher"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"grades; and from there downwards the poison gradually filters into all"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"branches of national life, thus causing a veritable decomposition. The"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"destructive workings of Judaism in different parts of the national body"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"can be ascribed fundamentally to the persistent Jewish efforts at"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"undermining the importance of personality among the nations that are"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"their hosts and, in place of personality, substituting the domination of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the masses. The constructive principle of Aryan humanity is thus"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"displaced by the destructive principle of the Jews, They become the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"'ferment of decomposition' among nations and races and, in a broad"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"sense, the wreckers of human civilization."	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"Marxism represents the most striking phase of the Jewish endeavour to"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"eliminate the dominant significance of personality in every sphere of"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"human life and replace it by the numerical power of the masses. In"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"politics the parliamentary form of government is the expression of this"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"smallest parish council upwards to the highest governing circles of the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"nation. In the field of economics we see the trade union movement, which"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"does not serve the real interests of the employees but the destructive"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"aims of international Jewry. Just to the same degree in which the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"principle of personality is excluded from the economic life of the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"its stead, national economy, which should be for the service and benefit"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"of the community as a whole, will gradually deteriorate in its creative"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"of the employees, strive to influence the process of production, serve"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"the same destructive purpose. They damage the general productive system"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"and consequently injure the individual engaged in industry. For in the"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"long run it is impossible to satisfy popular demands merely by"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"high-sounding theoretical phrases. These can be satisfied only by"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"supplying goods to meet the individual needs of daily life and by so"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"capable of taking over and developing the present economic system, that"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"would not signify anything. The question as to whether the Marxist"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"doctrine be right or wrong cannot be decided by any test which would"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"show that it can administer for the future what already exists to-day,"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"
"but only by asking whether it has the creative power to build up"	"CHAPTER XVII    WELTANSCHAUUNG AND ORGANIZATION"

"the external enemy had robbed these people of their reason. And one had"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"the German bourgeoisie done to call a halt to this terrible campaign of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"disintegration, to oppose it and open a way to a recognition of the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"As for myself, I then saw clearly that for the small group which first"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"composed our movement the question of war guilt had to be cleared up,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"and cleared up in the light of historical truth. A preliminary condition"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"for the future success of our movement was that it should bring"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"knowledge of the meaning of the peace treaties to the minds of the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"popular masses. In the opinion of the masses, the peace treaties then"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"signified a democratic success. Therefore, it was necessary to take the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"opposite side and dig ourselves into the minds of the people as the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"enemies of the peace treaties; so that later on, when the naked truth of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"people would recall the position which we then took and would give us"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"their confidence."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Already at that time I took up my stand on those important fundamental"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"questions where public opinion had gone wrong as a whole. I opposed"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"from being drawn into a general current which had been started"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"artificially, and indeed from sailing with it. The last occasion was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"when our German Press, the Hecuba of the existence of the German nation,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"succeeded in bringing the question of South Tyrol into a position of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"one quarter of the globe and to set the forces of national resistance"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"popular manoeuvre at that time, because all the leading forces of public"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"opinion had been active and a great flame of public feeling illuminated"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"only one direction. Such a decision almost always brings disfavour on"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"been stoned for an act for which posterity has afterwards thanked them"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"on its knees."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"But a movement must count on posterity and not on the plaudits of the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"movement. It may well be that at such moments certain individuals have"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"of liberation will come and that a movement which purposes to reshape"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"On this point it may be asserted that the greatest and most enduring"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"beginning, because they were in strong contrast to public opinion and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the views and wishes of the time."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"We had experience of this when we made our own first public appearance."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"In all truth it can be said that we did not court public favour but made"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"an onslaught on the follies of our people. In those days the following"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"happened almost always: I presented myself before an assembly of men who"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"believed the opposite of what I wished to say and who wanted the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"opposite of what I believed in. Then I had to spend a couple of hours in"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"persuading two or three thousand people to give up the opinions they had"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"first held, in destroying the foundations of their views with one blow"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"after another and finally in leading them over to take their stand on"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the grounds of our own convictions and our WELTANSCHAUUNG."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"I learned something that was important at that time, namely, to snatch"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"from the hands of the enemy the weapons which he was using in his reply."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"I soon noticed that our adversaries, especially in the persons of those"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"who led the discussion against us, were furnished with a definite"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"repertoire of arguments out of which they took points against our claims"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"which were being constantly repeated. The uniform character of this mode"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"of procedure pointed to a systematic and unified training. And so we"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"were able to recognize the incredible way in which the enemy's"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"propagandists had been disciplined, and I am proud to-day that I"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"discovered a means not only of making this propaganda ineffective but of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"beating the artificers of it at their own work. Two years later I was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"master of that art."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"In every speech which I made it was important to get a clear idea"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"beforehand of the probable form and matter of the counter-arguments we"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"had to expect in the discussion, so that in the course of my own speech"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"these could be dealt with and refuted. To this end it was necessary to"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"mention all the possible objections and show their inconsistency; it was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"all the easier to win over an honest listener by expunging from his"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"memory the arguments which had been impressed upon it, so that we"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"anticipated our replies. What he had learned was refuted without having"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"been mentioned by him and that made him all the more attentive to what I"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"had to say."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"That was the reason why, after my first lecture on the 'Peace Treaty of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Versailles,' which I delivered to the troops while I was still a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"political instructor in my regiment, I made an alteration in the title"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"and subject and henceforth spoke on 'The Treaties of Brest-Litowsk and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Versailles.' For after the discussion which followed my first lecture I"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"quickly ascertained that in reality people knew nothing about the Treaty"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"of Brest-Litowsk and that able party propaganda had succeeded in"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"presenting that Treaty as one of the most scandalous acts of violence in"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the history of the world."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"As a result of the persistency with which this falsehood was repeated"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"again and again before the masses of the people, millions of Germans saw"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"in the Treaty of Versailles a just castigation for the crime we had"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"committed at Brest-Litowsk. Thus they considered all opposition to"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Versailles as unjust and in many cases there was an honest moral dislike"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"to such a proceeding. And this was also the reason why the shameless and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"monstrous word 'Reparations' came into common use in Germany. This"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"hypocritical falsehood appeared to millions of our exasperated fellow"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"countrymen as the fulfilment of a higher justice. It is a terrible"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"thought, but the fact was so. The best proof of this was the propaganda"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"which I initiated against Versailles by explaining the Treaty of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Brest-Litowsk. I compared the two treaties with one another, point by"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"point, and showed how in truth the one treaty was immensely humane, in"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"contradistinction to the inhuman barbarity of the other. The effect was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"very striking. Then I spoke on this theme before an assembly of two"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"thousand persons, during which I often saw three thousand six hundred"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"hostile eyes fixed on me. And three hours later I had in front of me a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"swaying mass of righteous indignation and fury. A great lie had been"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"uprooted from the hearts and brains of a crowd composed of thousands of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"individuals and a truth had been implanted in its place."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"The two lectures--that 'On the Causes of the World War' and 'On the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Peace Treaties of Brest-Litowsk and Versailles' respectively--I then"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"considered as the most important of all. Therefore I repeated them"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"dozens of times, always giving them a new intonation; until at least on"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"those points a definitely clear and unanimous opinion reigned among"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"those from whom our movement recruited its first members."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Furthermore, these gatherings brought me the advantage that I slowly"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"became a platform orator at mass meetings, and gave me practice in the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"pathos and gesture required in large halls that held thousands of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"people."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Outside of the small circles which I have mentioned, at that time I"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"found no party engaged in explaining things to the people in this way."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Not one of these parties was then active which talk to-day as if it was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"they who had brought about the change in public opinion. If a political"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"leader, calling himself a nationalist, pronounced a discourse somewhere"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"or other on this theme it was only before circles which for the most"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"part were already of his own conviction and among whom the most that was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"done was to confirm them in their opinions. But that was not what was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"needed then. What was needed was to win over through propaganda and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"explanation those whose opinions and mental attitudes held them bound to"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the enemy's camp."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"The one-page circular was also adopted by us to help in this propaganda."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"While still a soldier I had written a circular in which I contrasted the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Treaty of Brest-Litowsk with that of Versailles. That circular was"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"printed and distributed in large numbers. Later on I used it for the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"party, and also with good success. Our first meetings were distinguished"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"by the fact that there were tables covered with leaflets, papers, and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"pamphlets of every kind. But we relied principally on the spoken word."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"And, in fact, this is the only means capable of producing really great"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"revolutions, which can be explained on general psychological grounds."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"In the first volume I have already stated that all the formidable events"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"which have changed the aspect of the world were carried through, not by"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the written but by the spoken word. On that point there was a long"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"discussion in a certain section of the Press during the course of which"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"our shrewd bourgeois people strongly opposed my thesis. But the reason"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"for this attitude confounded the sceptics. The bourgeois intellectuals"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"protested against my attitude simply because they themselves did not"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"have the force or ability to influence the masses through the spoken"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"word; for they always relied exclusively on the help of writers and did"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"not enter the arena themselves as orators for the purpose of arousing"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the people. The development of events necessarily led to that condition"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"of affairs which is characteristic of the bourgeoisie to-day, namely,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the loss of the psychological instinct to act upon and influence the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"masses."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"An orator receives continuous guidance from the people before whom he"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"speaks. This helps him to correct the direction of his speech; for he"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"can always gauge, by the faces of his hearers, how far they follow and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"understand him, and whether his words are producing the desired effect."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"But the writer does not know his reader at all. Therefore, from the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"outset he does not address himself to a definite human group of persons"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"which he has before his eyes but must write in a general way. Hence, up"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"to a certain extent he must fail in psychological finesse and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"flexibility. Therefore, in general it may be said that a brilliant"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"orator writes better than a brilliant writer can speak, unless the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"latter has continual practice in public speaking. One must also remember"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"that of itself the multitude is mentally inert, that it remains attached"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"to its old habits and that it is not naturally prone to read something"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"which does not conform with its own pre-established beliefs when such"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"writing does not contain what the multitude hopes to find there."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Therefore, some piece of writing which has a particular tendency is for"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the most part read only by those who are in sympathy with it. Only a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"leaflet or a placard, on account of its brevity, can hope to arouse a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"momentary interest in those whose opinions differ from it. The picture,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"in all its forms, including the film, has better prospects. Here there"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"is less need of elaborating the appeal to the intelligence. It is"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"sufficient if one be careful to have quite short texts, because many"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"people are more ready to accept a pictorial presentation than to read a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"long written description. In a much shorter time, at one stroke I might"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"say, people will understand a pictorial presentation of something which"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"it would take them a long and laborious effort of reading to understand."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"The most important consideration, however, is that one never knows into"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"what hands a piece of written material comes and yet the form in which"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"its subject is presented must remain the same. In general the effect is"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"greater when the form of treatment corresponds to the mental level of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the reader and suits his nature. Therefore, a book which is meant for"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"the broad masses of the people must try from the very start to gain its"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"effects through a style and level of ideas which would be quite"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"different from a book intended to be read by the higher intellectual"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"classes."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Only through his capacity for adaptability does the force of the written"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"word approach that of oral speech. The orator may deal with the same"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"subject as a book deals with; but if he has the genius of a great and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"popular orator he will scarcely ever repeat the same argument or the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"same material in the same form on two consecutive occasions. He will"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"always follow the lead of the great mass in such a way that from the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"living emotion of his hearers the apt word which he needs will be"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"suggested to him and in its turn this will go straight to the hearts of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"his hearers. Should he make even a slight mistake he has the living"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"correction before him. As I have already said, he can read the play of"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"expression on the faces of his hearers, first to see if they understand"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"what he says, secondly to see if they take in the whole of his argument,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"and, thirdly, in how far they are convinced of the justice of what has"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"been placed before them. Should he observe, first, that his hearers do"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"not understand him he will make his explanation so elementary and clear"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"that they will be able to grasp it, even to the last individual."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Secondly, if he feels that they are not capable of following him he will"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"make one idea follow another carefully and slowly until the most"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"slow-witted hearer no longer lags behind. Thirdly, as soon as he has the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"feeling that they do not seem convinced that he is right in the way he"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"has put things to them he will repeat his argument over and over again,"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"always giving fresh illustrations, and he himself will state their"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"unspoken objection. He will repeat these objections, dissecting them and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"refuting them, until the last group of the opposition show him by their"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"behaviour and play of expression that they have capitulated before his"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"exposition of the case."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"Not infrequently it is a case of overcoming ingrained prejudices which"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"are mostly unconscious and are supported by sentiment rather than"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"reason. It is a thousand times more difficult to overcome this barrier"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"of instinctive aversion, emotional hatred and preventive dissent than to"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"correct opinions which are founded on defective or erroneous knowledge."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"False ideas and ignorance may be set aside by means of instruction, but"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"emotional resistance never can. Nothing but an appeal to these hidden"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"forces will be effective here. And that appeal can be made by scarcely"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"any writer. Only the orator can hope to make it."	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"A very striking proof of this is found in the fact that, though we had a"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"bourgeois Press which in many cases was well written and produced and"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"
"had a circulation of millions among the people, it could not prevent the"	"CHAPTER XIV  THE CONFLICT WITH THE RED FORCES"

"once was the homogeneous uniformity of the audiences. Nearly always they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"

"speech, which in printed form may have read quite well, had a disastrous"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"effect. After three quarters of an hour the audience fell into a sort of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hypnotic trance, which was interrupted only when some man or woman left"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the hall, or by the clatter which the waitresses made, or by the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"

"intention whatsoever of interrupting the proceedings, nor indeed was it"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"necessary to interrupt them. At long last the celebration showed signs"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of drawing to a close. After the professor, whose voice had meanwhile"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"become more and more inaudible, finally ended his speech, the gentleman"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"without the monocle delivered a rousing peroration to the assembled"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"

"purpose was not to pour out a mixture of soft-soap bourgeois talk; what"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"we had to say was meant to arouse the opponents at our meetings! How"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"

"among them and, judging by the expression on all their faces, ready to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"finish us off there and then."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Yes, how often did they not turn up in huge numbers, those supporters of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the Red Flag, all previously instructed to smash up everything once and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"for all and put an end to these meetings. More often than not everything"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hung on a mere thread, and only the chairman's ruthless determination"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and the rough handling by our ushers baffled our adversaries'"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"intentions. And indeed they had every reason for being irritated."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The fact that we had chosen red as the colour for our posters sufficed"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"

"Socialism and Marxism still remains a mystery to these people up to this"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"day. The charge of Marxism was conclusively proved when it was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"discovered that at our meetings we deliberately substituted the words"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"'Fellow-countrymen and Women' for 'Ladies and Gentlemen' and addressed"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"each other as 'Party Comrade'. We used to roar with laughter at these"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"silly faint-hearted bourgeoisie and their efforts to puzzle out our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"origin, our intentions and our aims."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"attention and tempt them to come to our meetings--if only in order to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"break them up--so that in this way we got a chance of talking to the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"people."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In those years' it was indeed a delightful experience to follow the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"constantly changing tactics of our perplexed and helpless adversaries."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"First of all they appealed to their followers to ignore us and keep away"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"from our meetings. Generally speaking this appeal was heeded. But, as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"time went on, more and more of their followers gradually found their way"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to us and accepted our teaching. Then the leaders became nervous and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"uneasy. They clung to their belief that such a development should not be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ignored for ever, and that terror must be applied in order to put an end"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to it."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Appeals were then made to the 'class-conscious proletariat' to attend"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"our meetings in masses and strike with the clenched hand of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"proletarian at the representatives of a 'monarchist and reactionary"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"agitation'."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Our meetings suddenly became packed with work-people fully"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"three-quarters of an hour before the proceedings were scheduled to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"begin. These gatherings resembled a powder cask ready to explode at any"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"moment; and the fuse was conveniently at hand. But matters always turned"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"out differently. People came as enemies and left, not perhaps prepared"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to join us, yet in a reflective mood and disposed critically to examine"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the correctness of their own doctrine. Gradually as time went on my"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"three-hour lectures resulted in supporters and opponents becoming united"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in one single enthusiastic group of people. Every signal for the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"breaking-up of the meeting failed. The result was that the opposition"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"leaders became frightened and once again looked for help to those"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"quarters that had formerly discountenanced these tactics and, with some"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"show of right, had been of the opinion that on principle the workers"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"should be forbidden to attend our meetings."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Then they did not come any more, or only in small numbers. But after a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"short time the whole game started all over again. The instructions to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"keep away from us were ignored; the comrades came in steadily increasing"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"numbers, until finally the advocates of the radical tactics won the day."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"We were to be broken up."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Yet when, after two, three and even eight meetings, it was realized that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to break up these gatherings was easier said than done and that every"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting resulted in a decisive weakening of the red fighting forces,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"then suddenly the other password was introduced: 'Proletarians, comrades"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and comradesses, avoid meetings of the National Socialist agitators'."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The same eternally alternating tactics were also to be observed in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Red Press. Soon they tried to silence us but discovered the uselessness"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of such an attempt. After that they swung round to the opposite tactics."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Daily 'reference' was made to us solely for the purpose of absolutely"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ridiculing us in the eyes of the working-classes. After a time these"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"gentlemen must have felt that no harm was being done to us, but that, on"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the contrary, we were reaping an advantage in that people were asking"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"themselves why so much space was being devoted to a subject which was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"supposed to be so ludicrous. People became curious. Suddenly there was a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"change of tactics and for a time we were treated as veritable criminals"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"against mankind. One article followed the other, in which our criminal"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"intentions were explained and new proofs brought forward to support what"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"was said. Scandalous tales, all of them fabricated from start to finish,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"were published in order to help to poison the public mind. But in a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"short time even these attacks also proved futile; and in fact they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"assisted materially because they attracted public attention to us."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In those days I took up the standpoint that it was immaterial whether"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"they laughed at us or reviled us, whether they depicted us as fools or"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"criminals; the important point was that they took notice of us and that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in the eyes of the working-classes we came to be regarded as the only"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"force capable of putting up a fight. I said to myself that the followers"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of the Jewish Press would come to know all about us and our real aims."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"One reason why they never got so far as breaking up our meetings was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"undoubtedly the incredible cowardice displayed by the leaders of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"opposition. On every critical occasion they left the dirty work to the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"smaller fry whilst they waited outside the halls for the results of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"break up."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"We were exceptionally well informed in regard to our opponents'"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"intentions, not only because we allowed several of our party colleagues"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to remain members of the Red organizations for reasons of expediency,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"but also because the Red wire-pullers, fortunately for us, were"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"afflicted with a degree of talkativeness that is still unfortunately"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"very prevalent among Germans. They could not keep their own counsel, and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"more often than not they started cackling before the proverbial egg was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"laid. Hence, time and again our precautions were such that Red agitators"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had no inkling of how near they were to being thrown out of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meetings."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"This state of affairs compelled us to take the work of safeguarding our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meetings into our own hands. No reliance could be placed on official"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"protection. On the contrary; experience showed that such protection"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"always favoured only the disturbers. The only real outcome of police"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"intervention would be that the meeting would be dissolved, that is to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"say, closed. And that is precisely what our opponents granted."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Generally speaking, this led the police to adopt a procedure which, to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"say the least, was a most infamous sample of official malpractice. The"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"moment they received information of a threat that the one or other"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting was to be broken up, instead of arresting the would-be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"disturbers, they promptly advised the innocent parties that the meeting"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"was forbidden. This step the police proclaimed as a 'precautionary"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"measure in the interests of law and order'."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The political work and activities of decent people could therefore"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"always be hindered by desperate ruffians who had the means at their"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"disposal. In the name of peace and order State authority bowed down to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"these ruffians and demanded that others should not provoke them. When"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"National Socialism desired to hold meetings in certain parts and the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"labour unions declared that their members would resist, then it was not"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"these blackmailers that were arrested and gaoled. No. Our meetings were"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"forbidden by the police. Yes, this organ of the law had the unspeakable"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"impudence to advise us in writing to this effect in innumerable"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"instances. To avoid such eventualities, it was necessary to see to it"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that every attempt to disturb a meeting was nipped in the bud. Another"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"feature to be taken into account in this respect is that all meetings"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"which rely on police protection must necessarily bring discredit to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"their promoters in the eyes of the general public. Meetings that are"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"only possible with the protective assistance of a strong force of police"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"convert nobody; because in order to win over the lower strata of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"people there must be a visible show of strength on one's own side. In"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the same way that a man of courage will win a woman's affection more"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"easily than a coward, so a heroic movement will be more successful in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"winning over the hearts of a people than a weak movement which relies on"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"police support for its very existence."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"It is for this latter reason in particular that our young movement was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to be charged with the responsibility of assuring its own existence,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"defending itself; and conducting its own work of smashing the Red"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"opposition."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The work of organizing the protective measures for our meetings was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"based on the following:"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"(1) An energetic and psychologically judicious way of conducting the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"(2) An organized squad of troops to maintain order."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In those days we and no one else were masters of the situation at our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meetings and on no occasion did we fail to emphasize this. Our opponents"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"fully realized that any provocation would be the occasion of throwing"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"them out of the hall at once, whatever the odds against us. At meetings,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"particularly outside Munich, we had in those days from five to eight"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hundred opponents against fifteen to sixteen National Socialists; yet we"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"brooked no interference, for we were ready to be killed rather than"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"capitulate. More than once a handful of party colleagues offered a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"heroic resistance to a raging and violent mob of Reds. Those fifteen or"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"twenty men would certainly have been overwhelmed in the end had not the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"opponents known that three or four times as many of themselves would"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"first get their skulls cracked. Arid that risk they were not willing to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"run. We had done our best to study Marxist and bourgeois methods of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"conducting meetings, and we had certainly learnt something."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The Marxists had always exercised a most rigid discipline so that the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"question of breaking up their meetings could never have originated in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeois quarters. This gave the Reds all the more reason for acting on"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this plan. In time they not only became past-masters in this art but in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"certain large districts of the REICH they went so far as to declare that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"non-Marxist meetings were nothing less than a cause of' provocation"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"against the proletariat. This was particularly the case when the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"wire-pullers suspected that a meeting might call attention to their own"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"transgressions and thus expose their own treachery and chicanery."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Therefore the moment such a meeting was announced to be held a howl of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"rage went up from the Red Press. These detractors of the law nearly"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"always turned first to the authorities and requested in imperative and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"threatening language that this 'provocation of the proletariat' be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"stopped forthwith in the 'interests of law and order'. Their language"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"was chosen according to the importance of the official blockhead they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"were dealing with and thus success was assured. If by chance the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"official happened to be a true German--and not a mere figurehead--and he"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"declined the impudent request, then the time-honoured appeal to stop"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"'provocation of the proletariat' was issued together with instructions"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to attend such and such a meeting on a certain date in full strength for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the purpose of 'putting a stop to the disgraceful machinations of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeoisie by means of the proletarian fist'."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The pitiful and frightened manner in which these bourgeois meetings are"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"conducted must be seen in order to be believed. Very frequently these"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"threats were sufficient to call off such a meeting at once. The feeling"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of fear was so marked that the meeting, instead of commencing at eight"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"o'clock, very seldom was opened before a quarter to nine or nine"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"o'clock. The Chairman thereupon did his best, by showering compliments"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"on the 'gentleman of the opposition' to prove how he and all others"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"present were pleased (a palpable lie) to welcome a visit from men who as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"yet were not in sympathy with them for the reason that only by mutual"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"discussion (immediately agreed to) could they be brought closer together"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in mutual understanding. Apart from this the Chairman also assured them"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that the meeting had no intention whatsoever of interfering with the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"professed convictions of anybody. Indeed no. Everyone had the right to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"form and hold his own political views, but others should be allowed to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"do likewise. He therefore requested that the speaker be allowed to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"deliver his speech without interruption--the speech in any case not"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"being a long affair. People abroad, he continued, would thus not come to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"regard this meeting as another shameful example of the bitter fraternal"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"strife that is raging in Germany. And so on and so forth"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The brothers of the Left had little if any appreciation for that sort of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"talk; the speaker had hardly commenced when he was shouted down. One"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"gathered the impression at times that these speakers were graceful for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"being peremptorily cut short in their martyr-like discourse. These"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeois toreadors left the arena in the midst of a vast uproar, that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"is to say, provided that they were not thrown down the stairs with"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"cracked skulls, which was very often the case."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Therefore, our methods of organization at National Socialist meetings"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"were something quite strange to the Marxists. They came to our meetings"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in the belief that the little game which they had so often played could"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as a matter of course be also repeated on us. To-day we shall finish
them off. How often did they bawl this out to each other on entering"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the meeting hall, only to be thrown out with lightning speed before they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had time to repeat it."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In the first place our method of conducting a meeting was entirely"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"different. We did not beg and pray to be allowed to speak, and we did"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"not straightway give everybody the right to hold endless discussions. We"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"curtly gave everyone to understand that we were masters of the meeting"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and that we would do as it pleased us and that everyone who dared to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"interrupt would be unceremoniously thrown out. We stated clearly our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"refusal to accept responsibility for anyone treated in this manner. If"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"time permitted and if it suited us, a discussion would be allowed to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"take place. Our party colleague would now make his speech.... That kind"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of talk was sufficient in itself to astonish the Marxists."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Secondly, we had at our disposal a well-trained and organized body of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"men for maintaining order at our meetings. On the other hand the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeois parties protected their meetings with a body of men better"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"classified as ushers who by virtue of their age thought they were"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"entitled to-authority and respect. But as Marxism has little or no"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"respect for these things, the question of suitable self-protection at"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"these bourgeois meetings was, so to speak, in practice non-existent."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"When our political meetings first started I made it a special point to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"organize a suitable defensive squad--a squad composed chiefly of young"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"men. Some of them were comrades who had seen active service with me;"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"others were young party members who, right from the start, had been"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"trained and brought up to realize that only terror is capable of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"smashing terror--that only courageous and determined people had made a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"success of things in this world and that, finally, we were fighting for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"an idea so lofty that it was worth the last drop of our blood. These"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"young men had been brought up to realize that where force replaced"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"common sense in the solution of a problem, the best means of defence was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"attack and that the reputation of our hall-guard squads should stamp us"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as a political fighting force and not as a debating society."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And it was extraordinary how eagerly these boys of the War generation"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"responded to this order. They had indeed good reason for being bitterly"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"disappointed and indignant at the miserable milksop methods employed by"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the bourgeoise."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Thus it became clear to everyone that the Revolution had only been"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"possible thanks to the dastardly methods of a bourgeois government. At"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that time there was certainly no lack of man-power to suppress the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"revolution, but unfortunately there was an entire lack of directive"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"brain power. How often did the eyes of my young men light up with"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"enthusiasm when I explained to them the vital functions connected with"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"their task and assured them time and again that all earthly wisdom is"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"useless unless it be supported by a measure of strength, that the gentle"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"goddess of Peace can only walk in company with the god of War, and that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"every great act of peace must be protected and assisted by force. In"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this way the idea of military service came to them in a far more"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"realistic form--not in the fossilized sense of the souls of decrepit"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"officials serving the dead authority of a dead State, but in the living"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"realization of the duty of each man to sacrifice his life at all times"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so that his country might live."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"How those young men did their job!"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Like a swarm of hornets they tackled disturbers at our meetings,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"regardless of superiority of numbers, however great, indifferent to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"wounds and bloodshed, inspired with the great idea of blazing a trail"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"for the sacred mission of our movement."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"As early as the summer of 1920 the organization of squads of men as hall"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"guards for maintaining order at our meetings was gradually assuming"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"definite shape. By the spring of 1921 this body of men were sectioned"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"off into squads of one hundred, which in turn were sub-divided into"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"smaller groups."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The urgency for this was apparent, as meanwhile the number of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meetings had steadily increased. We still frequently met in the Munich"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Hofbräuhaus but more frequently in the large meeting halls throughout"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the city itself. In the autumn and winter of 1920-1921 our meetings in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the Bürgerbräu and Munich Kindlbräu had assumed vast proportions and it"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"was always the same picture that presented itself; namely, meetings of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the NSDAP (The German National Socialist Labour Party) were always"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"crowded out so that the police were compelled to close and bar the doors"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"long before proceedings commenced."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The organization of defence guards for keeping order at our meetings"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"cleared up a very difficult question. Up till then the movement had"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"possessed no party badge and no party flag. The lack of these tokens was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"not only a disadvantage at that time but would prove intolerable in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"future. The disadvantages were chiefly that members of the party"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"possessed no outward broken of membership which linked them together,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and it was absolutely unthinkable that for the future they should remain"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"without some token which would be a symbol of the movement and could be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"set against that of the International."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"More than once in my youth the psychological importance of such a symbol"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had become clearly evident to me and from a sentimental point of view"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"also it was advisable. In Berlin, after the War, I was present at a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"mass-demonstration of Marxists in front of the Royal Palace and in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Lustgarten. A sea of red flags, red armlets and red flowers was in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"itself sufficient to give that huge assembly of about 120,000 persons an"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"outward appearance of strength. I was now able to feel and understand"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"how easily the man in the street succumbs to the hypnotic magic of such"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"a grandiose piece of theatrical presentation."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The bourgeoisie, which as a party neither possesses or stands for any"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"WELTANSCHAUUNG, had therefore not a single banner. Their party was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"composed of 'patriots' who went about in the colours of the REICH. If"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"these colours were the symbol of a definite WELTANSCHAUUNG then one"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"could understand the rulers of the State regarding this flag as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"expressive of their own WELTANSCHAUUNG, seeing that through their"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"efforts the official REICH flag was expressive of their own"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"WELTANSCHAUUNG."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"But in reality the position was otherwise."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The REICH was morticed together without the aid of the German"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeoisie and the flag itself was born of the War and therefore merely"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"a State flag possessing no importance in the sense of any particular"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ideological mission."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Only in one part of the German-speaking territory--in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"German-Austria--was there anything like a bourgeois party flag in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"evidence. Here a section of the national bourgeoisie selected the 1848"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"colours (black, red and gold) as their party flag and therewith created"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"a symbol which, though of no importance from a weltanschauliche"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"viewpoint, had, nevertheless, a revolutionary character from a national"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"point of view. The most bitter opponents of this flag at that time, and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this should not be forgotten to-day, were the Social Democrats and the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Christian Socialists or clericals. They, in particular, were the ones"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"who degraded and besmirched these colours in the same way as in 1918"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"they dragged black, white and red into the gutter. Of course, the black,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"red and gold of the German parties in the old Austria were the colours"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of the year 1848: that is to say, of a period likely to be regarded as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"somewhat visionary, but it was a period that had honest German souls as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"its representatives, although the Jews were lurking unseen as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"wire-pullers in the background. It was high treason and the shameful"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"enslavement of the German territory that first of all made these colours"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so attractive to the Marxists of the Centre Party; so much so that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to-day they revere them as their most cherished possession and use them"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as their own banners for the protection of the flag they once foully"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"besmirched."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"It is a fact, therefore, that, up till 1920, in opposition to the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Marxists there was no flag that would have stood for a consolidated"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"resistance to them. For even if the better political elements of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"German bourgeoisie were loath to accept the suddenly discovered black,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"red and gold colours as their symbol after the year 1918, they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"nevertheless were incapable of counteracting this with a future"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"programme of their own that would correspond to the new trend of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"affairs. At the most, they had a reconstruction of the old REICH in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"mind."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And it is to this way of thinking that the black, white and red colours"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of the old REICH are indebted for their resurrection as the flag of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so-called national bourgeois parties."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"It was obvious that the symbol of a régime which had been overthrown by"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the Marxists under inglorious circumstances was not now worthy to serve"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as a banner under which the same Marxism was to be crushed in its turn."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"However much any decent German may love and revere those old colours,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"glorious when placed side by side in their youthful freshness, when he"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had fought under them and seen the sacrifice of so many lives, that flag"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had little value for the struggle of the future."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In our Movement I have always adopted the standpoint that it was a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"really lucky thing for the German nation that it had lost its old flag"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"(Note 18). This standpoint of mine was in strong contrast to that of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeois politicians. It may be immaterial to us what the Republic does"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"under its flag. But let us be deeply grateful to fate for having so"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"graciously spared the most glorious war flag for all time from becoming"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"an ignominious rag. The REICH of to-day, which sells itself and its"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"people, must never be allowed to adopt the honourable and heroic black,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"white and red colours."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"[Note 18. The flag of the German Empire, founded in 1871, was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Black-White-Red. This was discarded in 1918 and Black-Red-Gold was chosen"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as the flag of the German Republic founded at Weimar in 1919. The flag"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"designed by Hitler--red with a white disc in the centre, bearing the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"black swastika--is now the national flag.]"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"As long as the November outrage endures, that outrage may continue to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bear its own external sign and not steal that of an honourable past. Our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bourgeois politicians should awaken their consciences to the fact that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"whoever desires this State to have the black, white and red colours is"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"pilfering from the past. The old flag was suitable only for the old"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"REICH and, thank Heaven, the Republic chose the colours best suited to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"itself."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"This was also the reason why we National Socialists recognized that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hoisting the old colours would be no symbol of our special aims; for we"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had no wish to resurrect from the dead the old REICH which had been"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ruined through its own blunders, but to build up a new State."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The Movement which is fighting Marxism to-day along these lines must"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"display on its banner the symbol of the new State."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The question of the new flag, that is to say the form and appearance it"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"must take, kept us very busy in those days. Suggestions poured in from"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"all quarters, which although well meant were more or less impossible in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"practice. The new flag had not only to become a symbol expressing our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"own struggle but on the other hand it was necessary that it should prove"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"effective as a large poster. All those who busy themselves with the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"tastes of the public will recognize and appreciate the great importance"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of these apparently petty matters. In hundreds of thousands of cases a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"movement."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"For this reason we declined all suggestions from various quarters for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"identifying our movement by means of a white flag with the old State or"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"rather with those decrepit parties whose sole political objective is the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"restoration of past conditions. And, apart from this, white is not a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"colour capable of attracting and focusing public attention. It is a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"colour suitable only for young women's associations and not for a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"movement that stands for reform in a revolutionary period."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Black was also suggested--certainly well-suited to the times, but"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"embodying no significance to empress the will behind our movement. And,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"finally, black is incapable of attracting attention."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"White and blue was discarded, despite its admirable aesthetic appeal--as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"being the colours of an individual German Federal State--a State that,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"unfortunately, through its political attitude of particularist"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"narrow-mindedness did not enjoy a good reputation. And, generally"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"speaking, with these colours it would have been difficult to attract"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"attention to our movement. The same applies to black and white."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Black, red and gold did not enter the question at all."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And this also applies to black, white and red for reasons already"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"stated. At least, not in the form hitherto in use. But the effectiveness"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of these three colours is far superior to all the others and they are"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"certainly the most strikingly harmonious combination to be found."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"I myself was always for keeping the old colours, not only because I, as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"a soldier, regarded them as my most sacred possession, but because in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"their aesthetic effect, they conformed more than anything else to my"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"personal taste. Accordingly I had to discard all the innumerable"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"suggestions and designs which had been proposed for the new movement,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"among which were many that had incorporated the swastika into the old"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"colours. I, as leader, was unwilling to make public my own design, as it"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"was possible that someone else could come forward with a design just as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"good, if not better, than my own. As a matter of fact, a dental surgeon"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"from Starnberg submitted a good design very similar to mine, with only"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"one mistake, in that his swastika with curved corners was set upon a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"white background."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"After innumerable trials I decided upon a final form--a flag of red"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"material with a white disc bearing in its centre a black swastika. After"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"many trials I obtained the correct proportions between the dimensions of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the flag and of the white central disc, as well as that of the swastika."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And this is how it has remained ever since."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At the same time we immediately ordered the corresponding armlets for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"our squad of men who kept order at meetings, armlets of red material, a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"central white disc with the black swastika upon it. Herr Füss, a Munich"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"goldsmith, supplied the first practical and permanent design."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The new flag appeared in public in the midsummer of 1920. It suited our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"movement admirably, both being new and young. Not a soul had seen this"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"flag before; its effect at that time was something akin to that of a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"blazing torch. We ourselves experienced almost a boyish delight when one"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of the ladies of the party who had been entrusted with the making of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"flag finally handed it over to us. And a few months later those of us in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Munich were in possession of six of these flags. The steadily increasing"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"strength of our hall guards was a main factor in popularizing the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"symbol."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And indeed a symbol it proved to be."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Not only because it incorporated those revered colours expressive of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"German nation, but this symbol was also an eloquent expression of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"will behind the movement. We National Socialists regarded our flag as"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"being the embodiment of our party programme. The red expressed the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"social thought underlying the movement. White the national thought. And"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the swastika signified the mission allotted to us--the struggle for the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"victory of Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of the ideal"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of creative work which is in itself and always will be anti-Semitic."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Two years later, when our squad of hall guards had long since grown into"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"storm detachments, it seemed necessary to give this defensive"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"organization of a young WELTANSCHAUUNG a particular symbol of victory,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"namely a Standard. I also designed this and entrusted the execution of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"it to an old party comrade, Herr Gahr, who was a goldsmith. Ever since"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that time this Standard has been the distinctive token of the National"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Socialist struggle."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The increasing interest taken in our meetings, particularly during 1920,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"compelled us at times to hold two meetings a week. Crowds gathered round"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"our posters; the large meeting halls in the town were always filled and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"tens of thousands of people, who had been led astray by the teachings of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Marxism, found their way to us and assisted in the work of fighting for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the liberation of the REICH. The public in Munich had got to know us. We"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"were being spoken about. The words 'National Socialist' had become"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"common property to many and signified for them a definite party"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"programme. Our circle of supporters and even of members was constantly"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"increasing, so that in the winter of 1920-21 we were able to appear as a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"strong party in Munich."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At that time there was no party in Munich with the exception of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Marxist parties--certainly no nationalist party--which was able to hold"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"such mass demonstrations as ours. The Munich Kindl Hall, which held"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"5,000 people, was more than once overcrowded and up till then there was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"only one other hall, the Krone Circus Hall, into which we had not"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ventured."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At the end of January 1921 there was again great cause for anxiety in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Germany. The Paris Agreement, by which Germany pledged herself to pay"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the crazy sum of a hundred milliards of gold marks, was to be confirmed"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"by the London Ultimatum."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Thereupon an old-established Munich working committee, representative of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so-called VÖLKISCH groups, deemed it advisable to call for a public"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting of protest. I became nervous and restless when I saw that a lot"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of time was being wasted and nothing undertaken. At first a meeting was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"suggested in the KÖNIG PLATZ; on second thoughts this was turned down,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as someone feared the proceedings might be wrecked by Red elements."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Another suggestion was a demonstration in front of the Feldherrn Hall,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"but this also came to nothing. Finally a combined meeting in the Munich"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Kindl Hall was suggested. Meanwhile, day after day had gone by; the big"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"parties had entirely ignored the terrible event, and the working"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"committee could not decide on a definite date for holding the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"demonstration."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"On Tuesday, February 1st, I put forward an urgent demand for a final"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"decision. I was put off until Wednesday. On that day I demanded to be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"told clearly if and when the meeting was to take place. The reply was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"again uncertain and evasive, it being stated that it was 'intended' to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"arrange a demonstration that day week."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At that I lost all patience and decided to conduct a demonstration of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"protest on my own. At noon on Wednesday I dictated in ten minutes the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"text of the poster and at the same time hired the Krone Circus Hall for"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the next day, February 3rd."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In those days this was a tremendous venture. Not only because of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"uncertainty of filling that vast hall, but also because of the risk of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the meeting being wrecked."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Numerically our squad of hall guards was not strong enough for this vast"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hall. I was also uncertain about what to do in case the meeting was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"broken up--a huge circus building being a different proposition from an"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ordinary meeting hall. But events showed that my fears were misplaced,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the opposite being the case. In that vast building a squad of wreckers"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"could be tackled and subdued more easily than in a cramped hall."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"One thing was certain: A failure would throw us back for a long time to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"come. If one meeting was wrecked our prestige would be seriously injured"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and our opponents would be encouraged to repeat their success. That"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"would lead to sabotage of our work in connection with further meetings"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and months of difficult struggle would be necessary to overcome this."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"We had only one day in which to post our bills, Thursday. Unfortunately"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"it rained on the morning of that day and there was reason to fear that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"many people would prefer to remain at home rather than hurry to a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting through rain and snow, especially when there was likely to be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"violence and bloodshed."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"And indeed on that Thursday morning I was suddenly struck with fear that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the hall might never be filled to capacity, which would have made me"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ridiculous in the eyes of the working committee. I therefore immediately"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"dictated various leaflets, had them printed and distributed in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"afternoon. Of course they contained an invitation to attend the meeting."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Two lorries which I hired were draped as much as possible in red, each"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had our new flag hoisted on it and was then filled with fifteen or"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"twenty members of our party. Orders were given the members to canvas the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"streets thoroughly, distribute leaflets and conduct propaganda for the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"mass meeting to be held that evening. It was the first time that lorries"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had driven through the streets bearing flags and not manned by Marxists."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The public stared open-mouthed at these red-draped cars, and in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"outlying districts clenched fists were angrily raised at this new"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"evidence of 'provocation of the proletariat'. Were not the Marxists the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"only ones entitled to hold meetings and drive about in motor lorries?"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At seven o'clock in the evening only a few had gathered in the circus"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hall. I was being kept informed by telephone every ten minutes and was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"becoming uneasy. Usually at seven or a quarter past our meeting halls"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"were already half filled; sometimes even packed. But I soon found out"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the reason why I was uneasy. I had entirely forgotten to take into"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"account the huge dimensions of this new meeting place. A thousand people"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in the Hofbräuhaus was quite an impressive sight, but the same number in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the Circus building was swallowed up in its dimensions and was hardly"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"noticeable. Shortly afterwards I received more hopeful reports and at a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"quarter to eight I was informed that the hall was three-quarters filled,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"with huge crowds still lined up at the pay boxes. I then left for the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"I arrived at the Circus building at two minutes past eight. There was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"still a crowd of people outside, partly inquisitive people and many"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"opponents who preferred to wait outside for developments."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"When I entered the great hall I felt the same joy I had felt a year"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"previously at the first meeting in the Munich Hofbräu Banquet Hall; but"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"it was not until I had forced my way through the solid wall of people"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and reached the platform that I perceived the full measure of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"success. The hall was before me, like a huge shell, packed with"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"thousands and thousands of people. Even the arena was densely crowded."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"More than 5,600 tickets had been sold and, allowing for the unemployed,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"poor students and our own detachments of men for keeping order, a crowd"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of about 6,500 must have been present."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"My theme was 'Future or Downfall' and I was filled with joy at the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"conviction that the future was represented by the crowds that I was"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"addressing."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"I began, and spoke for about two and a half hours. I had the feeling"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"after the first half-hour that the meeting was going to be a big"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"success. Contact had been at once established with all those thousands"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of individuals. After the first hour the speech was already being"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"received by spontaneous outbreaks of applause, but after the second hour"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this died down to a solemn stillness which I was to experience so often"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"later on in this same hall, and which will for ever be remembered by all"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"those present. Nothing broke this impressive silence and only when the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"last word had been spoken did the meeting give vent to its feelings by"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"singing the national anthem."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"I watched the scene during the next twenty minutes, as the vast hall"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"slowly emptied itself, and only then did I leave the platform, a happy"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"man, and made my way home."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Photographs were taken of this first meeting in the Krone Circus Hall in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Munich. They are more eloquent than words to demonstrate the success of"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this demonstration. The bourgeois papers reproduced photographs and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"reported the meeting as having been merely 'nationalist' in character;"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in their usual modest fashion they omitted all mention of its promoters."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Thus for the first time we had developed far beyond the dimensions of an"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ordinary party. We could no longer be ignored. And to dispel all doubt"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that the meeting was merely an isolated success, I immediately arranged"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"for another at the Circus Hall in the following week, and again we had"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the same success. Once more the vast hall was overflowing with people;"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so much so that I decided to hold a third meeting during the following"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"week, which also proved a similar success."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"After these initial successes early in 1921 I increased our activity in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Munich still further. I not only held meetings once a week, but during"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"some weeks even two were regularly held and very often during midsummer"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and autumn this increased to three. We met regularly at the Circus Hall"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and it gave us great satisfaction to see that every meeting brought us"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the same measure of success."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The result was shown in an ever-increasing number of supporters and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"members into our party."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Naturally, such success did not allow our opponents to sleep soundly. At"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"first their tactics fluctuated between the use of terror and silence in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"our regard. Then they recognized that neither terror nor silence could"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hinder the progress of our movement. So they had recourse to a supreme"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"act of terror which was intended to put a definite end to our activities"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"in the holding of meetings."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"As a pretext for action along this line they availed themselves of a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"very mysterious attack on one of the Landtag deputies, named Erhard"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Auer. It was declared that someone had fired several shots at this man"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"one evening. This meant that he was not shot but that an attempt had"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"been made to shoot him. A fabulous presence of mind and heroic courage"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"on the part of Social Democratic leaders not only prevented the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"sacrilegious intention from taking effect but also put the crazy"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"would-be assassins to flight, like the cowards that they were. They were"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"so quick and fled so far that subsequently the police could not find"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"even the slightest traces of them. This mysterious episode was used by"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the organ of the Social Democratic Party to arouse public feeling"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"against the movement, and while doing this it delivered its old"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"rigmarole about the tactics that were to be employed the next time."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Their purpose was to see to it that our movement should not grow but"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"should be immediately hewn down root and branch by the hefty arm of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"proletariat."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"A few days later the real attack came. It was decided finally to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"interrupt one of our meetings which was billed to take place in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Munich Hofbräuhaus, and at which I myself was to speak."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"On November 4th, 1921, in the evening between six and seven o'clock I"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"received the first precise news that the meeting would positively be"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"broken up and that to carry out this action our adversaries had decided"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"to send to the meeting great masses of workmen employed in certain 'Red'"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"factories."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"It was due to an unfortunate accident that we did not receive this news"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"sooner. On that day we had given up our old business office in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Sternecker Gasse in Munich and moved into other quarters; or rather we"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"had given up the old offices and our new quarters were not yet in"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"functioning order. The telephone arrangements had been cut off by the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"former tenants and had not yet been reinstalled. Hence it happened that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"several attempts made that day to inform us by telephone of the break-up"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"which had been planned for the evening did not reach us."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Consequently our order troops were not present in strong force at that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting. There was only one squad present, which did not consist of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"usual one hundred men, but only of about forty-six. And our telephone"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"connections were not yet sufficiently organized to be able to give the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"alarm in the course of an hour or so, so that a sufficiently powerful"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"number of order troops to deal with the situation could be called. It"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"must also be added that on several previous occasions we had been"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"forewarned, but nothing special happened. The old proverb, 'Revolutions"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"which were announced have scarcely ever come off', had hitherto been"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"proved true in our regard."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Possibly for this reason also sufficiently strong precautions had not"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"been taken on that day to cope with the brutal determination of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"opponents to break up our meeting."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Finally, we did not believe that the Hofbräuhaus in Munich was suitable"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"for the interruptive tactics of our adversaries. We had feared such a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"thing far more in the bigger halls, especially that of the Krone Circus."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"But on this point we learned a very serviceable lesson that evening."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Later, we studied this whole question according to a scientific system"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and arrived at results, both interesting and incredible, and which"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"subsequently were an essential factor in the direction of our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"organization and in the tactics of our Storm Troops."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"When I arrived in the entrance halt of the Hofbräuhaus at 7.45 that"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"evening I realizcd that there could be no doubt as to what the 'Reds'"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"intended. The hall was filled, and for that reason the police had barred"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the entrances. Our adversaries, who had arrived very early, were in the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"hall, and our followers were for the most part outside. The small"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"bodyguard awaited me at the entrance. I had the doors leading to the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"principal hall closed and then asked the bodyguard of forty-five or"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"forty-six men to come forward. I made it clear to the boys that perhaps"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"on that evening for the first time they would have to show their"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"unbending and unbreakable loyalty to the movement and that not one of us"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"should leave the hall unless carried out dead. I added that I would"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"remain in the hall and that I did not believe that one of them would"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"abandon me, and that if I saw any one of them act the coward I myself"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"would personally tear off his armlet and his badge. I demanded of them"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that they should come forward if the slightest attempt to sabotage the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"meeting were made and that they must remember that the best defence is"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"always attack."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"I was greeted with a triple 'HEIL' which sounded more hoarse and violent"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"than usual."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Then I advanced through the hall and could take in the situation with my"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"own eyes. Our opponents sat closely huddled together and tried to pierce"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"me through with their looks. Innumerable faces glowing with hatred and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"rage were fixed on me, while others with sneering grimaces shouted at me"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"together. Now they would 'Finish with us. We must look out for our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"entrails. To-day they would smash in our faces once and for all.' And"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"there were other expressions of an equally elegant character. They knew"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"that they were there in superior numbers and they acted accordingly."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Yet we were able to open the meeting; and I began to speak. In the Hall"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of the Hofbräuhaus I stood always at the side, away from the entry and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"on top of a beer table. Therefore I was always right in the midst of the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"audience. Perhaps this circumstance was responsible for creating a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"certain feeling and a sense of agreement which I never found elsewhere."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Before me, and especially towards my left, there were only opponents,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"seated or standing. They were mostly robust youths and men from the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Maffei Factory, from Kustermann's, and from the factories on the Isar,"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"etc. Along the right-hand wall of the hall they were thickly massed"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"quite close to my table. They now began to order litre mugs of beer, one"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"after the other, and to throw the empty mugs under the table. In this"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"way whole batteries were collected. I should have been surprised had"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this meeting ended peacefully."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In spite of all the interruptions, I was able to speak for about an hour"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and a half and I felt as if I were master of the situation. Even the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"ringleaders of the disturbers appeared to be convinced of this; for they"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"steadily became more uneasy, often left the hall, returned and spoke to"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"their men in an obviously nervous way."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"A small psychological error which I committed in replying to an"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"interruption, and the mistake of which I myself was conscious the moment"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the words had left my mouth, gave the sign for the outbreak."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"There were a few furious outbursts and all in a moment a man jumped on a"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"seat and shouted Liberty. At that signal the champions of liberty"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"began their work."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"In a few moments the hall was filled with a yelling and shrieking mob."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Numerous beer-mugs flew like howitzers above their heads. Amid this"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"uproar one heard the crash of chair legs, the crashing of mugs, groans"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and yells and screams."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"It was a mad spectacle. I stood where I was and could observe my boys"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"doing their duty, every one of them."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"There I had the chance of seeing what a bourgeois meeting could be."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"The dance had hardly begun when my Storm Troops, as they were called"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"from that day onwards, launched their attack. Like wolves they threw"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"themselves on the enemy again and again in parties of eight or ten and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"began steadily to thrash them out of the hall. After five minutes I"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"could see hardly one of them that was not streaming with blood. Then I"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"realized what kind of men many of them were, above all my brave Maurice"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Hess, who is my private secretary to-day, and many others who, even"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"though seriously wounded, attacked again and again as long as they could"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"stand on their feet. Twenty minutes long the pandemonium continued. Then"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the opponents, who had numbered seven or eight hundred, had been driven"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"from the hall or hurled out headlong by my men, who had not numbered"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"fifty. Only in the left corner a big crowd still stood out against our"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"men and put up a bitter fight. Then two pistol shots rang out from the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"entrance to the hall in the direction of the platform and now a wild din"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"of shooting broke out from all sides. One's heart almost rejoiced at"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"this spectacle which recalled memories of the War."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"At that moment it was not possible to identify the person who had fired"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the shots. But at any rate I could see that my boys renewed the attack"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"with increased fury until finally the last disturbers were overcome and"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"flung out of the hall."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"About twenty-five minutes had passed since it all began. The hall looked"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"as if a bomb had exploded there. Many of my comrades had to be bandaged"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"and others taken away. But we remained masters of the situation. Hermann"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Essen, who was chairman of the meeting, announced: The meeting will
continue. The speaker shall proceed. So I went on with my speech."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"When we ourselves declared the meeting at an end an excited police"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"officer rushed in, waved his hands and declared: The meeting is
dissolved."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Without wishing to do so I had to laugh at this example of the law's"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"delay. It was the authentic constabulary officiosiousness. The smaller"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"they are the greater they must always appear."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"That evening we learned a real lesson. And our adversaries never forgot"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"the lesson they had received."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"Up to the autumn of 1923 the Münchener post did not again mention the"	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"clenched fists of the Proletariat."	"CHAPTER XV  CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE STATE"
"CHAPTER XX"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"In the preceding chapter I mentioned the existence of a co-operative"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"union between the German patriotic associations. Here I shall deal"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"briefly with this question."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"In speaking of a co-operative union we generally mean a group of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"associations which, for the purpose of facilitating their work,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"establish mutual relations for collaborating with one another along"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"certain lines, appointing a common directorate with varying powers and"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"thenceforth carrying out a common line of action. The average citizen is"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"pleased and reassured when he hears that these associations, by"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"establishing a co-operative union among one another, have at long last"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"discovered a common platform on which they can stand united and have"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"eliminated all grounds of mutual difference. Therewith a general"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"conviction arises, to the effect that such a union is an immense gain in"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"strength and that small groups which were weak as long as they stood"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"alone have now suddenly become strong. Yet this conviction is for the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"most part a mistaken one."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"It will be interesting and, in my opinion, important for the better"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"understanding of this question if we try to get a clear notion of how it"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"comes about that these associations, unions, etc., are established, when"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"all of them declare that they have the same ends in view. In itself it"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"would be logical to expect that one aim should be fought for by a single"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"association and it would be more reasonable if there were not a number"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of associations fighting for the same aim. In the beginning there was"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"undoubtedly only one association which had this one fixed aim in view."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"One man proclaimed a truth somewhere and, calling for the solution of a"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"definite question, fixed his aim and founded a movement for the purpose"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of carrying his views into effect."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"That is how an association or a party is founded, the scope of whose"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"programme is either the abolition of existing evils or the positive"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"establishment of a certain order of things in the future."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Once such a movement has come into existence it may lay practical claim"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"to certain priority rights. The natural course of things would now be"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"that all those who wish to fight for the same objective as this movement"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"is striving for should identify themselves with it and thus increase its"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"strength, so that the common purpose in view may be all the better"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"served. Especially men of superior intelligence must feel, one and all,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"that by joining the movement they are establishing precisely those"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"conditions which are necessary for practical success in the common"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"struggle. Accordingly it is reasonable and, in a certain sense,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"honest--which honesty, as I shall show later, is an element of very"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"great importance--that only one movement should be founded for the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"purpose of attaining the one aim."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"The fact that this does not happen must be attributed to two causes. The"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"first may almost be described as tragic. The second is a matter for"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"pity, because it has its foundation in the weaknesses of human nature."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"But, on going to the bottom of things, I see in both causes only facts"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"which give still another ground for strengthening our will, our energy"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"and intensity of purpose; so that finally, through the higher"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"development of the human faculties, the solution of the problem in"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"question may be rendered possible."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"The tragic reason why it so often happens that the pursuit of one"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"definite task is not left to one association alone is as follows:"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Generally speaking, every action carried out on the grand style in this"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"world is the expression of a desire that has already existed for a long"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"time in millions of human hearts, a longing which may have been"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"nourished in silence. Yes, it may happen that throughout centuries men"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"may have been yearning for the solution of a definite problem, because"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"they have been suffering under an unendurable order of affairs, without"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"seeing on the far horizon the coming fulfilment of the universal"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"longing. Nations which are no longer capable of finding an heroic"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"deliverance from such a sorrowful fate may be looked upon as effete."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"But, on the other hand, nothing gives better proof of the vital forces"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of a people and the consequent guarantee of its right to exist than that"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"one day, through a happy decree of Destiny, a man arises who is capable"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of liberating his people from some great oppression, or of wiping out"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"some bitter distress, or of calming the national soul which had been"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"tormented through its sense of insecurity, and thus fulfilling what had"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"long been the universal yearning of the people."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"An essential characteristic of what are called the great questions of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the time is that thousands undertake the task of solving them and that"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"many feel themselves called to this task: yea, even that Destiny itself"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"has proposed many for the choice, so that through the free play of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"forces the stronger and bolder shall finally be victorious and to him"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"shall be entrusted the task of solving the problem."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Thus it may happen that for centuries many are discontented with the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"form in which their religious life expresses itself and yearn for a"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"renovation of it; and so it may happen that through this impulse of the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"soul some dozens of men may arise who believe that, by virtue of their"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"understanding and their knowledge, they are called to solve the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"religious difficulties of the time and accordingly present themselves as"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the prophets of a new teaching or at least as declared adversaries of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the standing beliefs."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Here also it is certain that the natural law will take its course,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"inasmuch as the strongest will be destined to fulfil the great mission."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"But usually the others are slow to acknowledge that only one man is"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"called. On the contrary, they all believe that they have an equal right"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"to engage in the solution of the diffculties in question and that they"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"are equally called to that task. Their contemporary world is generally"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"quite unable to decide which of all these possesses the highest gifts"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"and accordingly merits the support of all."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"So in the course of centuries, or indeed often within the same epoch,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"different men establish different movements to struggle towards the same"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"end. At least the end is declared by the founders of the movements to be"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the same, or may be looked upon as such by the masses of the people. The"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"populace nourishes vague desires and has only general opinions, without"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"having any precise notion of their own ideals and desires or of the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"question whether and how it is impossible for these ideals and desires"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"to be fulfilled."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"The tragedy lies in the fact that many men struggle to reach the same"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"objective by different roads, each one genuinely believing in his own"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"mission and holding himself in duty bound to follow his own road without"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"any regard for the others."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"These movements, parties, religious groups, etc., originate entirely"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"independently of one another out of the general urge of the time, and"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"all with a view to working towards the same goal. It may seem a tragic"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"thing, at least at first sight, that this should be so, because people"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"are too often inclined to think that forces which are dispersed in"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"different directions would attain their ends far more quickly and more"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"surely if they were united in one common effort. But that is not so. For"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Nature herself decides according to the rules of her inexorable logic."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"She leaves these diverse groups to compete with one another and dispute"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the palm of victory and thus she chooses the clearest, shortest and"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"surest way along which she leads the movement to its final goal."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"How could one decide from outside which is the best way, if the forces"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"at hand were not allowed free play, if the final decision were to rest"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"with the doctrinaire judgment of men who are so infatuated with their"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"own superior knowledge that their minds are not open to accept the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"indisputable proof presented by manifest success, which in the last"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"analysis always gives the final confirmation of the justice of a course"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of action."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Hence, though diverse groups march along different routes towards the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"same objective, as soon as they come to know that analogous efforts are"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"being made around them, they will have to study all the more carefully"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"whether they have chosen the best way and whether a shorter way may not"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"be found and how their efforts can best be employed to reach the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"objective more quickly."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Through this rivalry each individual protagonist develops his faculties"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"to a still higher pitch of perfection and the human race has frequently"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"owed its progress to the lessons learned from the misfortunes of former"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"attempts which have come to grief. Therefore we may conclude that we"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"come to know the better ways of reaching final results through a state"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of things which at first sight appeared tragic; namely, the initial"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"dispersion of individual efforts, wherein each group was unconsciously"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"responsible for such dispersion."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"In studying the lessons of history with a view to finding a way for the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"solution of the German problem, the prevailing opinion at one time was"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"that there were two possible paths along which that problem might be"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"solved and that these two paths should have united from the very"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"beginning. The chief representatives and champions of these two paths"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"were Austria and Prussia respectively, Habsburg and Hohenzollern. All"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the rest, according to this prevalent opinion, ought to have entrusted"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"their united forces to the one or the other party. But at that time the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"path of the most prominent representative, the Habsburg, would have been"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"taken, though the Austrian policy would never have led to the foundation"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of a united German REICH."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Finally, a strong and united German REICH arose out of that which many"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"millions of Germans deplored in their hearts as the last and most"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"terrible manifestation of our fratricidal strife. The truth is that the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"German Imperial Crown was retrieved on the battle field of Königgrätz"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"and not in the fights that were waged before Paris, as was commonly"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"asserted afterwards."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Thus the foundation of the German REICH was not the consequence of any"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"common will working along common lines, but it was much more the outcome"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"of a deliberate struggle for hegemony, though the protagonists were"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"often hardly conscious of this. And from this struggle Prussia finally"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"came out victorious. Anybody who is not so blinded by partisan politics"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"as to deny this truth will have to agree that the so-called wisdom of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"men would never have come to the same wise decision as the wisdom of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Life itself, that is to say, the free play of forces, finally brought to"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"realization. For in the German lands of two hundred years before who"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"would seriously have believed that Hohenzollern Prussia, and not"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Habsburg, would become the germ cell, the founder and the tutor of the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"new REICH? And, on the other hand, who would deny to-day that Destiny"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"thus acted wiser than human wisdom. Who could now imagine a German REICH"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"based on the foundations of an effete and degenerate dynasty?"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"No. The general evolution of things, even though it took a century of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"struggle, placed the best in the position that it had merited."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"And that will always be so. Therefore it is not to be regretted if"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"different men set out to attain the same objective. In this way the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"strongest and swiftest becomes recognized and turns out to be the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"victor."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"Now there is a second cause for the fact that often in the lives of"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"nations several movements which show the same characteristics strive"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"along different ways to reach what appears to be the same goal. This"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"second cause is not at all tragic, but just something that rightly calls"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"forth pity. It arises from a sad mixture of envy, jealousy, ambition,"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"and the itch for taking what belongs to others. Unfortunately these"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"failings are often found united in single specimens of the human"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"species."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"The moment a man arises who profoundly understands the distress of his"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"people and, having diagnosed the evil with perfect accuracy, takes"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"measures to cure it; the moment he fixes his aim and chooses the means"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"to reach it--then paltry and pettifogging people become all attention"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"and eagerly follow the doings of this man who has thus come before the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"public gaze. Just like sparrows who are apparently indifferent, but in"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"reality are firmly intent on the movements of the fortunate companion"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"with the morsel of bread so that they may snatch it from him if he"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"should momentarily relax his hold on it, so it is also with the human"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"species. All that is needed is that one man should strike out on a new"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"road and then a crowd of poltroons will prick up their ears and begin to"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"sniff for whatever little booty may possibly lie at the end of that"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"road. The moment they think they have discovered where the booty is to"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"be gathered they hurry to find another way which may prove to be quicker"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"in reaching that goal."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"As soon as a new movement is founded and has formulated a definite"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"programme, people of that kind come forward and proclaim that they are"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"fighting for the same cause. This does not imply that they are ready"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"honestly to join the ranks of such a movement and thus recognize its"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"right of priority. It implies rather that they intend to steal the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"programme and found a new party on it. In doing this they are shameless"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"enough to assure the unthinking public that for a long time they had"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"intended to take the same line of action as the other has now taken, and"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"frequently they succeed in thus placing themselves in a favourable"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"light, instead of arousing the general disapprobation which they justly"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"deserve. For it is a piece of gross impudence to take what has already"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"been inscribed on another's flag and display it on one's own, to steal"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"the programme of another, and then to form a separate group as if all"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"had been created by the new founder of this group. The impudence of such"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"conduct is particularly demonstrated when the individuals who first"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"caused dispersion and disruption by their new foundation are those"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"who--as experience has shown--are most emphatic in proclaiming the"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"necessity of union and unity the moment they find they cannot catch up"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"with their adversary's advance."	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"
"It is to that kind of conduct that the so-called 'patriotic"	"CHAPTER XX THE STRONG IS STRONGEST WHEN ALONE"

"Because it was the Union that created most of the so-called states."	"CHAPTER XXII   THE MASK OF FEDERALISM"
"Therefore the sovereign rights, often very comprehensive, which were"	"CHAPTER XXII   THE MASK OF FEDERALISM"
"left, or rather granted, to the various territories correspond not only"	"CHAPTER XXII   THE MASK OF FEDERALISM"

"that hardly in any case did their frontiers coincide with ethical"	"CHAPTER XXII   THE MASK OF FEDERALISM"

"cudgel one's brains over problems of organization. The first necessity"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"was to spread our ideas among as many people as possible. Propaganda"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"should go well ahead of organization and gather together the human"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"Great masters of theory are only very rarely great organizers also. And"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"this is because the greatness of the theorist and founder of a system"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"consists in being able to discover and lay down those laws that are"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"right in the abstract, whereas the organizer must first of all be a man"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"of psychological insight. He must take men as they are, and for that"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"to the great masses must always be a psychologist, even though he may be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"only a demagogue. Therefore he will always be a much more capable leader"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"than the contemplative theorist who meditates on his ideas, far from the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"human throng and the world. For to be a leader means to be able to move"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the masses. The gift of formulating ideas has nothing whatsoever to do"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"with the capacity for leadership. It would be entirely futile to discuss"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the question as to which is the more important: the faculty of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"conceiving ideals and human aims or that of being able to have them put"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"into practice. Here, as so often happens in life, the one would be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"entirely meaningless without the other. The noblest conceptions of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"union which produces the great man."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"As I have already said, during my first period in the Party I devoted"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"gathering together a small nucleus of men who would accept the new"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"teaching and be inspired by it. And in this way we should provide the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"human material which subsequently would form the constituent elements of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the organization. Thus the goal of the propagandist is nearly always"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"fixed far beyond that of the organizer."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"If a movement proposes to overthrow a certain order of things and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"to collaborate in winning over new followers from which in turn new"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"members can be formed."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"To be a follower needs only the passive recognition of the idea. To be a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"member means to represent that idea and fight for it. From ten followers"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"one can have scarcely more than two members. To be a follower simply"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"implies that a man has accepted the teaching of the movement; whereas to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"be a member means that a man has the courage to participate actively in"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"diffusing that teaching in which he has come to believe."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Because of its passive character, the simple effort of believing in a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"political doctrine is enough for the majority, for the majority of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"mankind is mentally lazy and timid. To be a member one must be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"intellectually active, and therefore this applies only to the minority."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Such being the case, the propagandist must seek untiringly to acquire"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"new followers for the movement, whereas the organizer must diligently"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"look out for the best elements among such followers, so that these"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"elements may be transformed into members. The propagandist need not"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"trouble too much about the personal worth of the individual proselytes"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"he has won for the movement. He need not inquire into their abilities,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"actively helping to bring the movement to victory."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The propagandist aims at inducing the whole people to accept his"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"another in a definite mutual relationship. The better the propaganda has"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"worked, the smaller will the organization be. The greater the number of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"followers, so much the smaller can be the number of members. And"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"conversely. If the propaganda be bad, the organization must be large."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"And if there be only a small number of followers, the membership must be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"constantly reinvigorated and restrengthened. It is not necessary the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"be better. In view of the fact that only a fraction of humanity has"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"energy and courage, a movement which increases its own organization"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"indefinitely must of necessity one day become plethoric and inactive."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"It is on these grounds that we are to explain why so many movements"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"which were at first successful slowed down before reaching the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"fulfilment of their purpose and, from an inner weakness which could not"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"from the field. As a result of the early successes achieved, so many"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"undesirable, unworthy and especially timid individuals became members of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"nucleus. This means that the nucleus must direct the propaganda which"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"aims at securing general recognition for the movement. And the movement"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"itself, when it has secured power in its hands, must carry out all those"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"acts and measures which are necessary in order that its ideas should be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"finally established in practice."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"With those elements that originally made the movement, the organization"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"should occupy all the important positions that have been conquered and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"from those elements the whole directorate should be formed. This should"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"continue until the maxims and doctrines of the party have become the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"foundation and policy of the new State. Only then will it be permissible"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"gradually to give the reins into the hands of the Constitution of that"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"State which the spirit of the movement has created. But this usually"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"happens through a process of mutual rivalry, for here it is less a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"question of human intelligence than of the play and effect of the forces"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"whose development may indeed be foreseen from the start but not"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"perpetually controlled."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"All great movements, whether of a political or religious nature, owe"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"their imposing success to the recognition and adoption of those"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"principles. And no durable success is conceivable if these laws are not"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"observed."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"As director of propaganda for the party, I took care not merely to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"prepare the ground for the greatness of the movement in its subsequent"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"stages, but I also adopted the most radical measures against allowing"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"into the organization any other than the best material. For the more"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"radical and exciting my propaganda was, the more did it frighten weak"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and wavering characters away, thus preventing them from entering the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"first nucleus of our organization. Perhaps they remained followers, but"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"they did not raise their voices. On the contrary, they maintained a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"discreet silence on the fact. Many thousands of persons then assured me"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that they were in full agreement with us but they could not on any"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"account become members of our party. They said that the movement was so"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"radical that to take part in it as members would expose them to grave"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"censures and grave dangers, so that they would rather continue to be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"looked upon as honest and peaceful citizens and remain aside, for the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"time being at least, though devoted to our cause with all their hearts."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"And that was all to the good. If all these men who in their hearts did"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"not approve of revolutionary ideas came into our movement as members at"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that time, we should be looked upon as a pious confraternity to-day and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"not as a young movement inspired with the spirit of combat."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The lively and combative form which I gave to all our propaganda"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"fortified and guaranteed the radical tendency of our movement, and the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"result was that, with a few exceptions, only men of radical views were"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"disposed to become members."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"It was due to the effect of our propaganda that within a short period of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"time hundreds of thousands of citizens became convinced in their hearts"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that we were right and wished us victory, although personally they were"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"too timid to make sacrifices for our cause or even participate in it."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Up to the middle of 1921 this simple activity of gathering in followers"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"was sufficient and was of value to the movement. But in the summer of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that year certain events happened which made it seem opportune for us to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"bring our organization into line with the manifest successes which the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"propaganda had achieved."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"An attempt made by a group of patriotic visionaries, supported by the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"chairman of the party at that time, to take over the direction of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"party led to the break up of this little intrigue and, by a unanimous"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"vote at a general meeting, entrusted the entire direction of the party"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"to my own hands. At the same time a new statute was passed which"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"invested sole responsibility in the chairman of the movement, abolished"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the system of resolutions in committee and in its stead introduced the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"principle of division of labour which since that time has worked"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"excellently."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"From August 1st, 1921, onwards I undertook this internal reorganization"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"of the party and was supported by a number of excellent men. I shall"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"mention them and their work individually later on."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In my endeavour to turn the results gained by the propaganda to the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"advantage of the organization and thus stabilize them, I had to abolish"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"completely a number of old customs and introduce regulations which none"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"of the other parties possessed or had adopted."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In the years 1920-21 the movement was controlled by a committee elected"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"by the members at a general meeting. The committee was composed of a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"first and second treasurer, a first and second secretary, and a first"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and second chairman at the head of it. In addition to these there was a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"representative of the members, the director of propaganda, and various"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"assessors."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Comically enough, the committee embodied the very principle against"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"which the movement itself wanted to fight with all its energy, namely,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the principle of parliamentarianism. Here was a principle which"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"personified everything that was being opposed by the movement, from the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"smallest local groups to the district and regional groups, the state"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"groups and finally the national directorate itself. It was a system"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"under which we all suffered and are still suffering."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"It was imperative to change this state of affairs forthwith, if this bad"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"foundation in the internal organization was not to keep the movement"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"insecure and render the fulfilment of its high mission impossible."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The sessions of the committee, which were ruled by a protocol, and in"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"which decisions were made according to the vote of the majority,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"presented the picture of a miniature parliament. Here also there was no"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"such thing as personal responsibility. And here reigned the same"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"absurdities and illogical state of affairs as flourish in our great"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"representative bodies of the State. Names were presented to this"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"committee for election as secretaries, treasurers, representatives of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the members of the organization, propaganda agents and God knows what"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"else. And then they all acted in common on every particular question and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"decided it by vote. Accordingly, the director of propaganda voted on a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"question that concerned the man who had to do with the finances and the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"latter in his turn voted on a question that concerned only the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"organization as such, the organizer voting on a subject that had to do"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"with the secretarial department, and so on."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Why select a special man for propaganda if treasurers and scribes and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"commissaries, etc., had to deliver judgment on questions concerning it?"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"To a person of commonsense that sort of thing seemed as incomprehensible"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"as it would be if in a great manufacturing concern the board of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"directors were to decide on technical questions of production or if,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"inversely, the engineers were to decide on questions of administration."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"I refused to countenance that kind of folly and after a short time I"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"ceased to appear at the meetings of the committee. I did nothing else"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"except attend to my own department of propaganda and I did not permit"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"any of the others to poke their heads into my activities. Conversely, I"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"did not interfere in the affairs of others."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"When the new statute was approved and I was appointed as president, I"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"had the necessary authority in my hands and also the corresponding right"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"to make short shrift of all that nonsense. In the place of decisions by"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the majority vote of the committee, the principle of absolute"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"responsibility was introduced."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The chairman is responsible for the whole control of the movement. He"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"apportions the work among the members of the committee subordinate to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"him and for special work he selects other individuals. Each of these"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"gentlemen must bear sole responsibility for the task assigned to him. He"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"is subordinate only to the chairman, whose duty is to supervise the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"general collaboration, selecting the personnel and giving general"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"directions for the co-ordination of the common work."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"This principle of absolute responsibility is being adopted little by"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"little throughout the movement. In the small local groups and perhaps"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"also in the regional and district groups it will take yet a long time"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"before the principle can be thoroughly imposed, because timid and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"hesitant characters are naturally opposed to it. For them the idea of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"bearing absolute responsibility for an act opens up an unpleasant"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"prospect. They would like to hide behind the shoulders of the majority"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"in the so-called committee, having their acts covered by decisions"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"passed in that way. But it seems to me a matter of absolute necessity to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"take a decisive stand against that view, to make no concessions"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"whatsoever to this fear of responsibility, even though it takes some"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"time before we can put fully into effect this concept of duty and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"ability in leadership, which will finally bring forward leaders who have"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the requisite abilities to occupy the chief posts."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In any case, a movement which must fight against the absurdity of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"parliamentary institutions must be immune from this sort of thing. Only"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"thus will it have the requisite strength to carry on the struggle."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"At a time when the majority dominates everywhere else a movement which"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"is based on the principle of one leader who has to bear personal"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"responsibility for the direction of the official acts of the movement"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"itself will one day overthrow the present situation and triumph over the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"existing regime. That is a mathematical certainty."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"This idea made it necessary to reorganize our movement internally. The"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"logical development of this reorganization brought about a clear-cut"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"distinction between the economic section of the movement and the general"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"political direction. The principle of personal responsibility was"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"extended to all the administrative branches of the party and it brought"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"about a healthy renovation, by liberating them from political influences"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and allowing them to operate solely on economic principles."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In the autumn of 1921, when the party was founded, there were only six"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"members. The party did not have any headquarters, nor officials, nor"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"formularies, nor a stamp, nor printed material of any sort. The"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"committee first held its sittings in a restaurant on the Herrengasse and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"then in a café at Gasteig. This state of affairs could not last. So I at"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"once took action in the matter. I went around to several restaurants and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"hotels in Munich, with the idea of renting a room in one of them for the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"use of the Party. In the old Sterneckerbräu im Tal, there was a small"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"room with arched roof, which in earlier times was used as a sort of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"festive tavern where the Bavarian Counsellors of the Holy Roman Empire"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"foregathered. It was dark and dismal and accordingly well suited to its"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"ancient uses, though less suited to the new purpose it was now destined"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"to serve. The little street on which its one window looked out was so"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"narrow that even on the brightest summer day the room remained dim and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"sombre. Here we took up our first fixed abode. The rent came to fifty"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"marks per month, which was then an enormous sum for us. But our"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"exigencies had to be very modest. We dared not complain even when they"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"removed the wooden wainscoting a few days after we had taken possession."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"This panelling had been specially put up for the Imperial Counsellors."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The place began to look more like a grotto than an office."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Still it marked an important step forward. Slowly we had electric light"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"installed and later on a telephone. A table and some borrowed chairs"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"were brought, an open paper-stand and later on a cupboard. Two"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"sideboards, which belonged to the landlord, served to store our"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"leaflets, placards, etc."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"As time went on it turned out impossible to direct the course of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"movement merely by holding a committee meeting once a week. The current"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"business administration of the movement could not be regularly attended"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"to except we had a salaried official."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"But that was then very difficult for us. The movement had still so few"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"members that it was hard to find among them a suitable person for the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"job who would be content with very little for himself and at the same"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"time would be ready to meet the manifold demands which the movement"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"would make on his time and energy."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"After long searching we discovered a soldier who consented to become our"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"first administrator. His name was Schüssler, an old war comrade of mine."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"At first he came to our new office every day between six and eight"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"o'clock in the evening. Later on he came from five to eight and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"subsequently for the whole afternoon. Finally it became a full-time job"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and he worked in the office from morning until late at night. He was an"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"industrious, upright and thoroughly honest man, faithful and devoted to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the movement. He brought with him a small Adler typewriter of his own."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"It was the first machine to be used in the service of the party."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Subsequently the party bought it by paying for it in installments. We"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"needed a small safe in order to keep our papers and register of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"membership from danger of being stolen--not to guard our funds, which"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"did not then exist. On the contrary, our financial position was so"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"miserable that I often had to dip my hand into my own personal savings."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"After eighteen months our business quarters had become too small, so we"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"moved to a new place in the Cornelius Strasse. Again our office was in a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"restaurant, but instead of one room we now had three smaller rooms and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"one large room with great windows. At that time this appeared a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"wonderful thing to us. We remained there until the end of November 1923."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In December 1920, we acquired the VÖLKISCHER BEOBACHTER. This newspaper"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"which, as its name implies, championed the claims of the people, was now"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"to become the organ of the German National Socialist Labour Party. At"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"first it appeared twice weekly; but at the beginning of 1928 it became a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"daily paper, and at the end of August in the same year it began to"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"appear in the large format which is now well known."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"As a complete novice in journalism I then learned many a lesson for"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"which I had to pay dearly."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In contradistinction to the enormous number of papers in Jewish hands,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"there was at that time only one important newspaper that defended the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"cause of the people. This was a matter for grave consideration. As I"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"have often learned by experience, the reason for that state of things"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"must be attributed to the incompetent way in which the business side of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the so-called popular newspapers was managed. These were conducted too"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"much according to the rule that opinion should prevail over action that"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"produces results. Quite a wrong standpoint, for opinion is of itself"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"something internal and finds its best expression in productive activity."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The man who does valuable work for his people expresses thereby his"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"excellent sentiments, whereas another who merely talks about his"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"opinions and does nothing that is of real value or use to the people is"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"a person who perverts all right thinking. And that attitude of his is"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"also pernicious for the community."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"The VÖLKISCHE BEOBACHTER was a so-called 'popular' organ, as its name"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"indicated. It had all the good qualities, but still more the errors and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"weaknesses, inherent in all popular institutions. Though its contents"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"were excellent, its management as a business concern was simply"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"impossible. Here also the underlying idea was that popular newspapers"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"ought to be subsidized by popular contributions, without recognizing"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that it had to make its way in competition with the others and that it"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"was dishonest to expect the subscriptions of good patriots to make up"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"for the mistaken management of the undertaking."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"I took care to alter those conditions promptly, for I recognized the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"danger lurking in them. Luck was on my side here, inasmuch as it brought"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"me the man who since that time has rendered innumerable services to the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"movement, not only as business manager of the newspaper but also as"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"business manager of the party. In 1914, in the War, I made the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"acquaintance of Max Amann, who was then my superior and is to-day"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"general business Director of the Party. During four years in the War I"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"had occasion to observe almost continually the unusual ability, the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"diligence and the rigorous conscientiousness of my future collaborator."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"In the summer of 1921 I applied to my old regimental comrade, whom I met"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"one day by chance, and asked him to become business manager of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"movement. At that time the movement was passing through a grave crisis"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and I had reason to be dissatisfied with several of our officials, with"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"one of whom I had had a very bitter experience. Amann then held a good"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"situation in which there were also good prospects for him."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"After long hesitation he agreed to my request, but only on condition"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that he must not be at the mercy of incompetent committees. He must be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"responsible to one master, and only one."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"It is to the inestimable credit of this first business manager of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"party, whose commercial knowledge is extensive and profound, that he"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"brought order and probity into the various offices of the party. Since"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"that time these have remained exemplary and cannot be equalled or"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"excelled in this by any other branches of the movement. But, as often"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"happens in life, great ability provokes envy and disfavour. That had"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"also to be expected in this case and borne patiently."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Since 1922 rigorous regulations have been in force, not only for the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"commercial construction of the movement but also in the organization of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"it as such. There exists now a central filing system, where the names"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"and particulars of all the members are enrolled. The financing of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"party has been placed on sound lines. The current expenditure must be"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"covered by the current receipts and special receipts can be used only"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"for special expenditures. Thus, notwithstanding the difficulties of the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"time the movement remained practically without any debts, except for a"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"few small current accounts. Indeed, there was a permanent increase in"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the funds. Things are managed as in a private business. The employed"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"personnel hold their jobs in virtue of their practical efficiency and"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"could not in any manner take cover behind their professed loyalty to the"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"party. A good National Socialist proves his soundness by the readiness,"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"diligence and capability with which he discharges whatever duties are"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"assigned to him in whatever situation he holds within the national"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"community. The man who does not fulfil his duty in the job he holds"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"cannot boast of a loyalty against which he himself really sins."	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"Adamant against all kinds of outer influence, the new business director"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"of the party firmly maintained the standpoint that there were no"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"sinecure posts in the party administration for followers and members of"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"
"the movement whose pleasure is not work. A movement which fights so"	"CHAPTER XXIII   PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATION"

"In the first volume of this book I have already expressed my views on"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the nature and purpose and necessity of trade unions. There I took up"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the standpoint that unless measures are undertaken by the State (usually"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"futile in such cases) or a new ideal is introduced in our education,"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"which would change the attitude of the employer towards the worker, no"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"interests himself by appealing to his equal rights as a contracting"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"party within the economic sphere of the nation's existence. I stated"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"further that this would conform to the interests of the national"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"community if thereby social injustices could be redressed which"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"otherwise would cause serious damage to the whole social structure. I"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"stated, moreover, that the worker would always find it necessary to"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"undertake this protective action as long as there were men among the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"employers who had no sense of their social obligations nor even of the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"association made up of the workers themselves on the basis of trades"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"unions."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"This was my general idea and it remained the same in 1922. But a clear"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"and precise formula was still to be discovered. We could not be"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"satisfied with merely understanding the problem. It was necessary to"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"come to some conclusions that could be put into practice. The following"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"questions had to be answered:"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"(1) Are trade unions necessary?"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"(2) Should the German National Socialist Labour Party itself operate on"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"a trade unionist basis or have its members take part in trade unionist"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"activities in some form or other?"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"(3) What form should a National Socialist Trades Union take? What are"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the tasks confronting us and the ends we must try to attain?"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"(4) How can we establish trade unions for such tasks and aims?"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"I think that I have already answered the first question adequately. In"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the present state of affairs I am convinced that we cannot possibly"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"dispense with the trades unions. On the contrary, they are among the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"most important institutions in the economic life of the nation. Not only"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"are they important in the sphere of social policy but also, and even"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"more so, in the national political sphere. For when the great masses of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"a nation see their vital needs satisfied through a just trade unionist"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"movement the stamina of the whole nation in its struggle for existence"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"will be enormously reinforced thereby."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"Before everything else, the trades unions are necessary as building"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"stones for the future economic parliament, which will be made up of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"chambers representing the various professions and occupations."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"The second question is also easy to answer. If the trade unionist"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"movement is important, then it is clear that National Socialism ought to"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"take a definite stand on that question, not only theoretically but also"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"in practice. But how? That is more difficult to see clearly."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"The National Socialist Movement, which aims at establishing the National"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"Socialist People's State, must always bear steadfastly in mind the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"principle that every future institution under that State must be rooted"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"in the movement itself. It is a great mistake to believe that by"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"acquiring possession of supreme political power we can bring about a"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"definite reorganization, suddenly starting from nothing, without the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"help of a certain reserve stock of men who have been trained beforehand,"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"especially in the spirit of the movement. Here also the principle holds"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"good that the spirit is always more important than the external form"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"which it animates; since this form can be created mechanically and"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"quickly. For instance, the leadership principle may be imposed on an"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"organized political community in a dictatorial way. But this principle"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"can become a living reality only by passing through the stages that are"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"necessary for its own evolution. These stages lead from the smallest"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"cell of the State organism upwards. As its bearers and representatives,"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the leadership principle must have a body of men who have passed through"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"a process of selection lasting over several years, who have been"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"tempered by the hard realities of life and thus rendered capable of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"carrying the principle into practical effect."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"It is out of the question to think that a scheme for the Constitution of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"a State can be pulled out of a portfolio at a moment's notice and"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"'introduced' by imperative orders from above. One may try that kind of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"thing but the result will always be something that has not sufficient"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"vitality to endure. It will be like a stillborn infant. The idea of it"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"history during the last half century."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"The National Socialist State must guard against all such experiments. It"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"must grow out of an organization which has already existed for a long"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"so that finally it may be able to establish a National Socialist State"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"that will be a living reality."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"As I have already said, the germ cells of this State must lie in the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"are to be National Socialist institutions, these important germ cells"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"must be vehicles of the National Socialist concept of life. The"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"institutions of the movement are to be brought over into the State; for"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the State cannot call into existence all of a sudden and as if by magic"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"those institutions which are necessary to its existence, unless it"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"Looking at the matter from the highest standpoint, the National"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"Socialist Movement will have to recognize the necessity of adopting its"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"things rests on foundations that are internally sound and not merely an"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"external façade."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"Hence the movement must adopt a positive attitude towards the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"The National Socialist Trades Union is not an instrument for class"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"callings. The National Socialist State recognizes no 'classes'. But,"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"under the political aspect, it recognizes only citizens with absolutely"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"equal rights and equal obligations corresponding thereto. And, side by"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"side with these, it recognizes subjects of the State who have no"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"political rights whatsoever."	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"According to the National Socialist concept, it is not the task of the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"and thus gradually transform these men into a class, so as to use them"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"in a conflict against other groups similarly organized within the"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"national community. We certainly cannot assign this task to the trades"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"union as such. This was the task assigned to it the moment it became a"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"fighting weapon in the hands of the Marxists. The trades union is not"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"naturally an instrument of class warfare; but the Marxists transformed"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"it into an instrument for use in their own class struggle. They created"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"the economic weapon which the international Jew uses for the purpose of"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"
"destroying the economic foundations of free and independent national"	"CHAPTER XXIV  THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE UNIONS"

"foreign relations. That was one of the first tasks to be accomplished in"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"order to prepare the ground for the practical carrying out of a foreign"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"policy which would win back the independence of the nation in managing"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"its external affairs and thus restore the real sovereignty of the REICH."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The fundamental and guiding principles which we must always bear in mind"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"when studying this question is that foreign policy is only a means to an"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"end and that the sole end to be pursued is the welfare of our own"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"people. Every problem in foreign politics must be considered from this"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"point of view, and this point of view alone. Shall such and such a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"solution prove advantageous to our people now or in the future, or will"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"it injure their interests? That is the question."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"This is the sole preoccupation that must occupy our minds in dealing"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"with a question. Party politics, religious considerations, humanitarian"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"ideals--all such and all other preoccupations must absolutely give way"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to this."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Before the War the purpose to which German foreign policy should have"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"been devoted was to assure the supply of material necessities for the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"maintenance of our people and their children. And the way should have"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"been prepared which would lead to this goal. Alliances should have been"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"established which would have proved beneficial to us from this point of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"view and would have brought us the necessary auxiliary support. The task"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to be accomplished is the same to-day, but with this difference: In"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"pre-War times it was a question of caring for the maintenance of the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"German people, backed up by the power which a strong and independent"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"State then possessed, but our task to-day is to make our nation powerful"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"once again by re-establishing a strong and independent State. The"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"re-establishment of such a State is the prerequisite and necessary"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"condition which must be fulfilled in order that we may be able"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"subsequently to put into practice a foreign policy which will serve to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"guarantee the existence of our people in the future, fulfilling their"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"needs and furnishing them with those necessities of life which they"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"lack. In other words, the aim which Germany ought to pursue to-day in"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"her foreign policy is to prepare the way for the recovery of her liberty"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to-morrow. In this connection there is a fundamental principle which we"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"must keep steadily before our minds. It is this: The possibility of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"winning back the independence of a nation is not absolutely bound up"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"with the question of territorial reintegration but it will suffice if a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"small remnant, no matter how small, of this nation and State will exist,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"provided it possesses the necessary independence to become not only the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"vehicle of' the common spirit of the whole people but also to prepare"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the way for the military fight to reconquer the nation's liberty."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"When a people who amount to a hundred million souls tolerate the yoke of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"common slavery in order to prevent the territory belonging to their"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"State from being broken up and divided, that is worse than if such a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"State and such a people were dismembered while one fragment still"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"retained its complete independence. Of course, the natural proviso here"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"is that this fragment must be inspired with a consciousness of the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"solemn duty that devolves upon it, not only to proclaim persistently the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"inviolable unity of its spiritual and cultural life with that of its"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"detached members but also to prepare the means that are necessary for"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the military conflict which will finally liberate and re-unite the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"fragments that are suffering under oppression."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"One must also bear in mind the fact that the restoration of lost"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"districts which were formerly parts of the State, both ethnically and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"politically, must in the first instance be a question of winning back"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"political power and independence for the motherland itself, and that in"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"such cases the special interests of the lost districts must be"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"uncompromisingly regarded as a matter of secondary importance in the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"face of the one main task, which is to win back the freedom of the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"central territory. For the detached and oppressed fragments of a nation"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"or an imperial province cannot achieve their liberation through the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"expression of yearnings and protests on the part of the oppressed and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"abandoned, but only when the portion which has more or less retained its"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"sovereign independence can resort to the use of force for the purpose of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"reconquering those territories that once belonged to the common"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"fatherland."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Therefore, in order to reconquer lost territories the first condition to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"be fulfilled is to work energetically for the increased welfare and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"reinforcement of the strength of that portion of the State which has"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"remained over after the partition. Thus the unquenchable yearning which"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"slumbers in the hearts of the people must be awakened and restrengthened"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"by bringing new forces to its aid, so that when the hour comes all will"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"be devoted to the one purpose of liberating and uniting the whole"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"people. Therefore, the interests of the separated territories must be"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"subordinated to the one purpose. That one purpose must aim at obtaining"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"for the central remaining portion such a measure of power and might that"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"will enable it to enforce its will on the hostile will of the victor and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"thus redress the wrong. For flaming protests will not restore the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"oppressed territories to the bosom of a common REICH. That can be done"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"only through the might of the sword."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The forging of this sword is a work that has to be done through the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"domestic policy which must be adopted by a national government. To see"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"that the work of forging these arms is assured, and to recruit the men"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"who will bear them, that is the task of the foreign policy."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"In the first volume of this book I discussed the inadequacy of our"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"policy of alliances before the War. There were four possible ways to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"secure the necessary foodstuffs for the maintenance of our people. Of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"these ways the fourth, which was the most unfavourable, was chosen."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Instead of a sound policy of territorial expansion in Europe, our rulers"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"embarked on a policy of colonial and trade expansion. That policy was"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"all the more mistaken inasmuch as they presumed that in this way the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"danger of an armed conflict would be averted. The result of the attempt"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to sit on many stools at the same time might have been foreseen. It let"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"us fall to the ground in the midst of them all. And the World War was"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"only the last reckoning presented to the REICH to pay for the failure of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"its foreign policy."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The right way that should have been taken in those days was the third"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"way I indicated: namely, to increase the strength of the REICH as a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Continental Power by the acquisition of new territory in Europe. And at"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the same time a further expansion, through the subsequent acquisition of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"colonial territory, might thus be brought within the range of practical"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"politics. Of course, this policy could not have been carried through"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"except in alliance with England, or by devoting such abnormal efforts to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the increase of military force and armament that, for forty or fifty"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"years, all cultural undertakings would have to be completely relegated"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to the background. This responsibility might very well have been"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"undertaken. The cultural importance of a nation is almost always"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"dependent on its political freedom and independence. Political freedom"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"is a prerequisite condition for the existence, or rather the creation,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"of great cultural undertakings. Accordingly no sacrifice can be too"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"great when there is question of securing the political freedom of a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"nation. What might have to be deducted from the budget expenses for"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"cultural purposes, in order to meet abnormal demands for increasing the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"military power of the State, can be generously paid back later on."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Indeed, it may be said that after a State has concentrated all its"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"resources in one effort for the purpose of securing its political"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"independence a certain period of ease and renewed equilibrium sets in."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"And it often happens that the cultural spirit of the nation, which had"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"been heretofore cramped and confined, now suddenly blooms forth. Thus"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Greece experienced the great Periclean era after the miseries it had"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"suffered during the Persian Wars. And the Roman Republic turned its"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"energies to the cultivation of a higher civilization when it was freed"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"from the stress and worry of the Punic Wars."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Of course, it could not be expected that a parliamentary majority of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"feckless and stupid people would be capable of deciding on such a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"resolute policy for the absolute subordination of all other national"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"interests to the one sole task of preparing for a future conflict of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"arms which would result in establishing the security of the State. The"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"father of Frederick the Great sacrificed everything in order to be ready"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"for that conflict; but the fathers of our absurd parliamentarian"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"democracy, with the Jewish hall-mark, could not do it."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"That is why, in pre-War times, the military preparation necessary to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"enable us to conquer new territory in Europe was only very mediocre, so"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"that it was difficult to obtain the support of really helpful allies."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Those who directed our foreign affairs would not entertain even the idea"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"of systematically preparing for war. They rejected every plan for the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"acquisition of territory in Europe. And by preferring a policy of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"colonial and trade expansion, they sacrificed the alliance with England,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"which was then possible. At the same time they neglected to seek the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"support of Russia, which would have been a logical proceeding. Finally"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"they stumbled into the World War, abandoned by all except the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"ill-starred Habsburgs."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The characteristic of our present foreign policy is that it follows no"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"discernible or even intelligible lines of action. Whereas before the War"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"a mistake was made in taking the fourth way that I have mentioned, and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"this was pursued only in a halfhearted manner, since the Revolution not"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"even the sharpest eye can detect any way that is being followed. Even"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"more than before the War, there is absolutely no such thing as a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"systematic plan, except the systematic attempts that are made to destroy"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the last possibility of a national revival."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"If we make an impartial examination of the situation existing in Europe"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to-day as far as concerns the relation of the various Powers to one"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"another, we shall arrive at the following results:"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"For the past three hundred years the history of our Continent has been"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"definitely determined by England's efforts to keep the European States"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"opposed to one another in an equilibrium of forces, thus assuring the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"necessary protection of her own rear while she pursued the great aims of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"British world-policy."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The traditional tendency of British diplomacy ever since the reign of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Queen Elizabeth has been to employ systematically every possible means"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to prevent any one Power from attaining a preponderant position over the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"other European Powers and, if necessary, to break that preponderance by"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"means of armed intervention. The only parallel to this has been the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"tradition of the Prussian Army. England has made use of various forces"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to carry out its purpose, choosing them according to the actual"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"situation or the task to be faced; but the will and determination to use"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"them has always been the same. The more difficult England's position"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"became in the course of history the more the British Imperial Government"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"considered it necessary to maintain a condition of political paralysis"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"among the various European States, as a result of their mutual"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"rivalries. When the North American colonies obtained their political"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"independence it became still more necessary for England to use every"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"effort to establish and maintain the defence of her flank in Europe. In"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"accordance with this policy she reduced Spain and the Netherlands to the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"position of inferior naval Powers. Having accomplished this, England"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"concentrated all her forces against the increasing strength of France,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"until she brought about the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte and therewith"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"destroyed the military hegemony of France, which was the most dangerous"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"rival that England had to fear."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The change of attitude in British statesmanship towards Germany took"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"place only very slowly, not only because the German nation did not"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"represent an obvious danger for England as long as it lacked national"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"unification, but also because public opinion in England, which had been"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"directed to other quarters by a system of propaganda that had been"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"carried out for a long time, could be turned to a new direction only by"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"slow degrees. In order to reach the proposed ends the calmly reflecting"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"statesman had to bow to popular sentiment, which is the most powerful"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"motive-force and is at the same time the most lasting in its energy."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"When the statesman has attained one of his ends, he must immediately"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"turn his thoughts to others; but only by degrees and the slow work of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"propaganda can the sentiment of the masses be shaped into an instrument"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"for the attainment of the new aims which their leaders have decided on."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"As early as 1870-71 England had decided on the new stand it would take."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"On certain occasions minor oscillations in that policy were caused by"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the growing influence of America in the commercial markets of the world"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"and also by the increasing political power of Russia; but,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"unfortunately, Germany did not take advantage of these and, therefore,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the original tendency of British diplomacy was only reinforced."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"England looked upon Germany as a Power which was of world importance"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"commercially and politically and which, partly because of its enormous"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"industrial development, assumed such threatening proportions that the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"two countries already contended against one another in the same sphere"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"and with equal energy. The so-called peaceful conquest of the world by"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"commercial enterprise, which, in the eyes of those who governed our"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"public affairs at that time, represented the highest peak of human"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"wisdom, was just the thing that led English statesmen to adopt a policy"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"of resistance. That this resistance assumed the form of an organized"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"aggression on a vast scale was in full conformity with a type of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"statesmanship which did not aim at the maintenance of a dubious world"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"peace but aimed at the consolidation of British world-hegemony. In"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"carrying out this policy, England allied herself with those countries"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"which had a definite military importance. And that was in keeping with"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"her traditional caution in estimating the power of her adversary and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"also in recognizing her own temporary weakness. That line of conduct"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"cannot be called unscrupulous; because such a comprehensive organization"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"for war purposes must not be judged from the heroic point of view but"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"from that of expediency. The object of a diplomatic policy must not be"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to see that a nation goes down heroically but rather that it survives in"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"a practical way. Hence every road that leads to this goal is opportune"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"and the failure to take it must be looked upon as a criminal neglect of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"duty."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"When the German Revolution took place England's fears of a German world"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"hegemony came to a satisfactory end."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"From that time it was not an English interest to see Germany totally"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"cancelled from the geographic map of Europe. On the contrary, the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"astounding collapse which took place in November 1918 found British"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"diplomacy confronted with a situation which at first appeared untenable."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"For four-and-a-half years the British Empire had fought to break the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"presumed preponderance of a Continental Power. A sudden collapse now"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"happened which removed this Power from the foreground of European"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"affairs. That collapse disclosed itself finally in the lack of even the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"primordial instinct of self-preservation, so that European equilibrium"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"was destroyed within forty-eight hours. Germany was annihilated and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"

"purpose of encouraging the British public to stick it out to the end"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"aroused all the primitive instincts and passions of the populace and was"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"bound eventually to hang as a leaden weight on the decisions of British"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"statesmen. With the colonial, economical and commercial destruction of"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"Germany, England's war aims were attained. Whatever went beyond those"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"

"Great Continental Power in Europe. In November 1918, however, and up to"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the summer of 1919, it was not possible for England to change its"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"diplomatic attitude; because during the long war it had appealed, more"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"than it had ever done before, to the feelings of the populace. In view"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"of the feeling prevalent among its own people, England could not change"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"its foreign policy; and another reason which made that impossible was"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the military strength to which other European Powers had now attained."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"France had taken the direction of peace negotiations into her own hands"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"

"Here I must briefly answer the objections which may be raised in regard"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to the three questions I have put."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"1. Is it possible at all to form an alliance with the present Germany,"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"whose weakness is so visible to all eyes?"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"2. Can the ex-enemy nations change their attitude towards Germany?"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"3. In other nations is not the influence of Jewry stronger than the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"recognition of their own interests, and does not this influence thwart"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"all their good intentions and render all their plans futile?"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"I think that I have already dealt adequately with one of the two aspects"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"of the first point. Of course nobody will enter into an alliance with"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"the present Germany. No Power in the world would link its fortunes with"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"a State whose government does not afford grounds for the slightest"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"confidence. As regards the attempt which has been made by many of our"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"compatriots to explain the conduct of the Government by referring to the"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"woeful state of public feeling and thus excuse such conduct, I must"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"strongly object to that way of looking at things."	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"The lack of character which our people have shown during the last six"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"years is deeply distressing. The indifference with which they have"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"treated the most urgent necessities of our nation might veritably lead"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"one to despair. Their cowardice is such that it often cries to heaven"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"for vengeance. But one must never forget that we are dealing with a"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"people who gave to the world, a few years previously, an admirable"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"example of the highest human qualities. From the first days of August"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"1914 to the end of the tremendous struggle between the nations, no"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"people in the world gave a better proof of manly courage, tenacity and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"patient endurance, than this people gave who are so cast down and"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"dispirited to-day. Nobody will dare to assert that the lack of character"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"among our people to-day is typical of them. What we have to endure"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"to-day, among us and around us, is due only to the influence of the sad"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"and distressing effects that followed the high treason committed on"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"
"November 9th, 1918. More than ever before the word of the poet is true:"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"

"qualities among our people which are fundamentally sound are not"	"CHAPTER XXV THE GERMAN POST-WAR POLICY OF ALLIANCES"

"postulate:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"When we speak of foreign politics we understand that domain of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"government which has set before it the task of managing the affairs of a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"nation in its relations with the rest of the world. Now the guiding"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"principles which must be followed in managing these affairs must be"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"based on the definite facts that are at hand. Moreover, as National"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Socialists, we must lay down the following axiom regarding the manner in"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"which the foreign policy of a People's State should be conducted:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"The foreign policy of a People's State must first of all bear in mind"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the duty of securing the existence of the race which is incorporated in"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"this State. And this must be done by establishing a healthy and natural"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"proportion between the number and growth of the population on the one"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"hand and the extent and resources of the territory they inhabit, on the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"other. That balance must be such that it accords with the vital"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"necessities of the people."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"What I call a HEALTHY proportion is that in which the support of a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"people is guaranteed by the resources of its own soil and sub-soil. Any"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"situation which falls short of this condition is none the less unhealthy"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"even though it may endure for centuries or even a thousand years. Sooner"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"or later, this lack of proportion must of necessity lead to the decline"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"or even annihilation of the people concerned."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Only a sufficiently large space on this earth can assure the independent"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"of importance not only as the source of the nation's foodstuffs and raw"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"materials, but also from the political and military standpoints. Once a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"ourselves have been witnesses to this, seeing that the gigantic struggle"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"that went on from 1914 to 1918 was only the struggle of the German"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"a way that it has become known in history as the World War."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"When Germany entered this struggle it was presumed that she was a World"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"World Power and, if we leave other factors out of count, the War would"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"have ended in our favour."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"absolutely incumbent on me to show the present conditions in their bare"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"that at least in the ranks of the National Socialist Movement they"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"should receive the necessary recognition."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany is not at all a World Power to-day. Even though our present"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"proportion between the size of the population and the territorial area"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"is so miserable as in the present German REICH? At an epoch in which the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"world is being gradually portioned out among States many of whom almost"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"of a State whose political motherland is confined to a territorial area"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of barely five-hundred-thousand square kilometres."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Looked at purely from the territorial point of view, the area comprised"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"in the German REICH is insignificant in comparison with the other States"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"that are called World Powers. England must not be cited here as an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"reality the great metropolis of the British World Empire, which owns"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"almost a fourth of the earth's surface. Next to this we must consider"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the American Union as one of the foremost among the colossal States,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"also Russia and China. These are enormous spaces, some of which are more"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"than ten times greater in territorial extent than the present German"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"REICH. France must also be ranked among these colossal States. Not only"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"because she is adding to the strength of her army in a constantly"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"increasing measure by recruiting coloured troops from the population of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"her gigantic empire, but also because France is racially becoming more"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"and more negroid, so much so that now one can actually speak of the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"creation of an African State on European soil. The contemporary colonial"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"policy of France cannot be compared with that of Germany in the past. If"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"France develops along the lines it has taken in our day, and should that"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"development continue for the next three hundred years, all traces of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"French blood will finally be submerged in the formation of a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Euro-African Mulatto State. This would represent a formidable and"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"compact colonial territory stretching from the Rhine to the Congo,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"inhabited by an inferior race which had developed through a slow and"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"steady process of bastardization."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"That process distinguishes French colonial policy from the policy"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"followed by the old Germany."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"The former German colonial policy was carried out by half-measures, as"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"was almost everything they did at that time. They did not gain an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"expanse of territory for the settlement of German nationals nor did they"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"attempt to reinforce the power of the REICH through the enlistment of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"black troops, which would have been a criminal undertaking. The Askari"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"in German East Africa represented a small and hesitant step along this"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"road; but in reality they served only for the defence of the colony"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"itself. The idea of importing black troops to a European theatre of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"war--apart entirely from the practical impossibility of this in the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"World War--was never entertained as a proposal to be carried out under"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"favourable circumstances; whereas, on the contrary, the French always"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"looked on such an idea as fundamental in their colonial activities."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Thus we find in the world to-day not only a number of States that are"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"much greater than the German in the mere numerical size of their"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"populations, but also possess a greater support for their political"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"power. The proportion between the territorial dimensions of the German"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"REICH and the numerical size of its population was never so unfavourable"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"in comparison with the other world States as at the beginning of our"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"history two thousand years ago and again to-day. At the former juncture"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"we were a young people and we stormed a world which was made up of great"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"States that were already in a decadent condition, of which the last"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"giant was Rome, to whose overthrow we contributed. To-day we find"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"ourselves in a world of great and powerful States, among which the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"importance of our own REICH is constantly declining more and more."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"We must always face this bitter truth with clear and calm minds. We must"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"study the area and population of the German REICH in relation to the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"other States and compare them down through the centuries. Then we shall"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"find that, as I have said, Germany is not a World Power whether its"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"military strength be great or not."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"There is no proportion between our position and that of the other States"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"people that the great aim of their foreign policy ought to be to right"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the wrongs of 1918, while at the same time they consider it incumbent on"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"In regard to this point I should like to make the following statement:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"To demand that the 1914 frontiers should be restored is a glaring"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"political absurdity that is fraught with such consequences as to make"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the claim itself appear criminal. The confines of the REICH as they"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"existed in 1914 were thoroughly illogical; because they were not really"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"complete, in the sense of including all the members of the German"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"nation. Nor were they reasonable, in view of the geographical exigencies"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of military defence. They were not the consequence of a political plan"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"which had been well considered and carried out. But they were temporary"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"frontiers established in virtue of a political struggle that had not"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"been brought to a finish; and indeed they were partly the chance result"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of circumstances. One would have just as good a right, and in many cases"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"a better right, to choose some other outstanding year than 1914 in the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"course of our history and demand that the objective of our foreign"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"policy should be the re-establishment of the conditions then existing."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"The demands I have mentioned are quite characteristic of our bourgeois"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"obstinacy. Therefore, we must regard it as quite natural that the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"proclaiming that the aim of their political activities is to have the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"individual State feels itself aimed at and threatened by this programme."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"And the programme is absurd, for the following two reasons:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"(1) Because there are no available means of extricating it from the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"twilight atmosphere of political soirees and transforming it into"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"reality."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"(2) Even if it could be really carried into effect the result would be"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"the blood of our people once again for such a purpose."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"For there can be scarcely any doubt whatsoever that only through"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"Therefore, the question ought not to be what Bismarck then did, but"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"count for nothing. We should have practically nothing to oppose to the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"general motorization of the world, which in the next war will make its"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"appearance in an overwhelming and decisive form. In this important field"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany has not only shamefully lagged behind, but with the little it"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"has it would have to reinforce Russia, which at the present moment does"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"not possess a single factory capable of producing a motor gun-wagon."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Under such conditions the presupposed coming struggle would assume the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"character of sheer slaughter. The German youth would have to shed more"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of its blood than it did even in the world war; for, as always, the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"honour of fighting will fall on us alone, and the result would be an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"inevitable catastrophe. But even admitting that a miracle were produced"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"and that this war did not end in the total annihilation of Germany, the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"final result would be that the German nation would be bled white, and,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"surrounded by great military States, its real situation would be in no"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"way ameliorated."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"It is useless to object here that in case of an alliance with Russia we"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"should not think of an immediate war or that, anyhow, we should have"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"means of making thorough preparations for war. No. An alliance which is"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"not for the purpose of waging war has no meaning and no value. Even"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"though at the moment when an alliance is concluded the prospect of war"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"is a distant one, still the idea of the situation developing towards war"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"is the profound reason for entering into an alliance. It is out of the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"question to think that the other Powers would be deceived as to the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"purpose of such an alliance. A Russo-German coalition would remain"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"either a matter of so much paper--and in this case it would have no"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"meaning for us--or the letter of the treaty would be put into practice"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"visibly, and in that case the rest of the world would be warned. It"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"would be childish to think that in such circumstances England and France"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"would wait for ten years to give the Russo-German alliance time to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"complete its technical preparations. No. The storm would break over"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany immediately."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Therefore the fact of forming an alliance with Russia would be the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"signal for a new war. And the result of that would be the end of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"To these considerations the following must be added:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"(1) Those who are in power in Russia to-day have no idea of forming an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"honourable alliance or of remaining true to it, if they did."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"It must never be forgotten that the present rulers of Russia are"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"blood-stained criminals, that here we have the dregs of humanity which,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"favoured by the circumstances of a tragic moment, overran a great State,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"degraded and extirpated millions of educated people out of sheer"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"blood-lust, and that now for nearly ten years they have ruled with such"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"a savage tyranny as was never known before. It must not be forgotten"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"that these rulers belong to a people in whom the most bestial cruelty is"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"allied with a capacity for artful mendacity and believes itself to-day"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"more than ever called to impose its sanguinary despotism on the rest of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the world. It must not be forgotten that the international Jew, who is"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"to-day the absolute master of Russia, does not look upon Germany as an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"ally but as a State condemned to the same doom as Russia. One does not"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"form an alliance with a partner whose only aim is the destruction of his"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"fellow-partner. Above all, one does not enter into alliances with people"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"for whom no treaty is sacred; because they do not move about this earth"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"as men of honour and sincerity but as the representatives of lies and"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"deception, thievery and plunder and robbery. The man who thinks that he"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"can bind himself by treaty with parasites is like the tree that believes"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"it can form a profitable bargain with the ivy that surrounds it."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"(2) The menace to which Russia once succumbed is hanging steadily over"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany. Only a bourgeois simpleton could imagine that Bolshevism can be"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"tamed. In his superficial way of thinking he does not suspect that here"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"we are dealing with a phenomenon that is due to an urge of the blood:"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"namely, the aspiration of the Jewish people to become the despots of the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"world. That aspiration is quite as natural as the impulse of the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Anglo-Saxon to sit in the seats of rulership all over the earth. And as"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the Anglo-Saxon chooses his own way of reaching those ends and fights"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"for them with his characteristic weapons, so also does the Jew. The Jew"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"wriggles his way in among the body of the nations and bores them hollow"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"from inside. The weapons with which he works are lies and calumny,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"poisonous infection and disintegration, until he has ruined his hated"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"adversary. In Russian Bolshevism we ought to recognize the kind of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"attempt which is being made by the Jew in the twentieth century to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"secure dominion over the world. In other epochs he worked towards the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"same goal but with different, though at bottom similar, means. The kind"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of effort which the Jew puts forth springs from the deepest roots in the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"nature of his being. A people does not of itself renounce the impulse to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"increase its stock and power. Only external circumstances or senile"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"impotence can force them to renounce this urge. In the same way the Jew"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"will never spontaneously give up his march towards the goal of world"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"dictatorship or repress his external urge. He can be thrown back on his"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"road only by forces that are exterior to him, for his instinct towards"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"world domination will die out only with himself. The impotence of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"nations and their extinction through senility can come only when their"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"blood has remained no longer pure. And the Jewish people preserve the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"purity of their blood better than any other nation on earth. Therefore"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the Jew follows his destined road until he is opposed by a force"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"superior to him. And then a desperate struggle takes place to send back"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"to Lucifer him who would assault the heavens."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"To-day Germany is the next battlefield for Russian Bolshevism. All the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"force of a fresh missionary idea is needed to raise up our nation once"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"more, to rescue it from the coils of the international serpent and stop"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the process of corruption which is taking place in the internal"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"repetition of the recent catastrophe from taking place even in the most"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"distant future. If this be the goal we set to ourselves it would be"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"folly to ally ourselves with a country whose master is the mortal enemy"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of our future. How can we release our people from this poisonous grip if"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"we accept the same grip ourselves? How can we teach the German worker"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"that Bolshevism is an infamous crime against humanity if we ally"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"demands that we should declare our position towards Soviet Russia. We"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"cannot cast out the Devil through Beelzebub. If nationalist circles"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"to-day grow enthusiastic about the idea of an alliance with Bolshevism,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"Press can be beneficial for the German people? Since when has the Jew"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"One special reproach which could be made against the old German REICH"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"with regard to its policy of alliances was that it spoiled its relations"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"towards all others by continually swinging now this way and now that way"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"and by its weakness in trying to preserve world peace at all costs. But"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"one reproach which cannot be made against it is that it did not continue"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"to maintain good relations with Russia."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"I admit frankly that before the War I thought it would have been better"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"if Germany had abandoned her senseless colonial policy and her naval"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"policy and had joined England in an alliance against Russia, therewith"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"the idea of acquiring new territory on the Continent. I do not forget"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the constant insolent threats which Pan-Slavist Russia made against"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany. I do not forget the continual trial mobilizations, the sole"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"object of which was to irritate Germany. I cannot forget the tone of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"public opinion in Russia which in pre-War days excelled itself in"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"hate-inspired outbursts against our nation and REICH. Nor can I forget"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"But, in spite of everything, there was still a second way possible"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"before the War. We might have won the support of Russia and turned"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"against England. Circumstances are entirely different to-day. If, before"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the War, throwing all sentiment to the winds, we could have marched by"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the side of Russia, that is no longer possible for us to-day. Since then"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the hand of the world-clock has moved forward. The hour has struck and"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"which it would be worth while for us to strive to form a close alliance"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"and that this alliance would be advantageous. I should like here to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"The military consequences of forming this alliance would be the direct"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"opposite of the consequences of an alliance with Russia. Most important"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of all is the fact that a RAPPROCHEMENT with England and Italy would in"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"no way involve a danger of war. The only Power that could oppose such an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"arrangement would be France; and France would not be in a position to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"make war. But the alliance should allow to Germany the possibility of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"making those preparations in all tranquillity which, within the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"framework of such a coalition, might in one way or another be requisite"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"in view of a regulation of accounts with France. For the full"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"significance of such an alliance lies in the fact that on its conclusion"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany would no longer be subject to the threat of a sudden invasion."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"The coalition against her would disappear automatically; that is to say,"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the Entente which brought such disaster to us. Thus France, the mortal"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"success would have only a moral effect, it would be sufficient to give"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Germany such liberty of action as we cannot now imagine. For the new"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"Anglo-German-Italian alliance would hold the political initiative and no"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"longer France."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"A further success would be that at one stroke Germany would be delivered"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"from her unfavourable strategical situation. On the one side her flank"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"would be strongly protected; and, on the other, the assurance of being"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"able to import her foodstuffs and raw materials would be a beneficial"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"result of this new alignment of States. But almost of greater importance"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"would be the fact that this new League would include States that possess"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"technical qualities which mutually supplement each other. For the first"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"time Germany would have allies who would not be as vampires on her"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"economic body but would contribute their part to complete our technical"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"equipment. And we must not forget a final fact: namely, that in this"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"case we should not have allies resembling Turkey and Russia to-day. The"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"greatest World Power on this earth and a young national State would"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"As I have already said, great difficulties would naturally be made to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"hinder the conclusion of such an alliance. But was not the formation of"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"the Entente somewhat more difficult? Where King Edward VII succeeded"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"partly against interests that were of their nature opposed to his work"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"we must and will succeed, if the recognition of the necessity of such a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"possible when, incited to action by the miseries of our situation, we"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"shall adopt a definite purpose and follow it out systematically instead"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"of the defective foreign policy of the last decades, which never had a"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"fixed purpose in view."	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"The future goal of our foreign policy ought not to involve an"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"policy which will have in view the acquisition of such territory as is"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"hegemony in Europe unbearable. No attempt to approach those Powers ought"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"to appear too difficult for us, and no sacrifice should be considered"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"too heavy, if the final outcome would be to make it possible for us to"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"
"overthrow our bitterest enemy. The minor wounds will be cured by the"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"preaching in favour of that which our most profound conviction tells us"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"In a few years Fate may raise us up as a dam against which the general"	"CHAPTER XXVI  GERMANY'S POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPES"

"After we had laid down our arms, in November 1918, a policy was adopted"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"which in all human probability was bound to lead gradually to our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"complete subjugation. Analogous examples from history show that those"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"nations which lay down their arms without being absolutely forced to do"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"so subsequently prefer to submit to the greatest humiliations and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"exactions rather than try to change their fate by resorting to arms"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"again."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"That is intelligible on purely human grounds. A shrewd conqueror will"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"always enforce his exactions on the conquered only by stages, as far as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that is possible. Then he may expect that a people who have lost all"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"strength of character--which is always the case with every nation that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"voluntarily submits to the threats of an opponent--will not find in any"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of these acts of oppression, if one be enforced apart from the other,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"sufficient grounds for taking up arms again. The more numerous the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"extortions thus passively accepted so much the less will resistance"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"appear justified in the eyes of other people, if the vanquished nation"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"should end by revolting against the last act of oppression in a long"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"series. And that is specially so if the nation has already patiently and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"silently accepted impositions which were much more exacting."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The fall of Carthage is a terrible example of the slow agony of a people"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"which ended in destruction and which was the fault of the people"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"themselves."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"In his THREE ARTICLES OF FAITH Clausewitz expressed this idea admirably"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"and gave it a definite form when he said: The stigma of shame incurred
by a cowardly submission can never be effaced. The drop of poison which
thus enters the blood of a nation will be transmitted to posterity. It
will undermine and paralyse the strength of later generations. But, on"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the contrary, he added: Even the loss of its liberty after a sanguinary
and honourable struggle assures the resurgence of the nation and is the
vital nucleus from which one day a new tree can draw firm roots."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Naturally a nation which has lost all sense of honour and all strength"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of character will not feel the force of such a doctrine. But any nation"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that takes it to heart will never fall very low. Only those who forget"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"it or do not wish to acknowledge it will collapse. Hence those"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"responsible for a cowardly submission cannot be expected suddenly to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"take thought with themselves, for the purpose of changing their former"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"conduct and directing it in the way pointed out by human reason and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"experience. On the contrary, they will repudiate such a doctrine, until"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the people either become permanently habituated to the yoke of slavery"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"or the better elements of the nation push their way into the foreground"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"and forcibly take power away from the hands of an infamous and corrupt"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"regime. In the first case those who hold power will be pleased with the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"state of affairs, because the conquerors often entrust them with the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"task of supervising the slaves. And these utterly characterless beings"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"then exercise that power to the detriment of their own people, more"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"cruelly than the most cruel-hearted stranger that might be nominated by"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the enemy himself."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The events which happened subsequent to 1918 in Germany prove how the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"hope of securing the clemency of the victor by making a voluntary"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"submission had the most disastrous influence on the political views and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"conduct of the broad masses. I say the broad masses explicitly, because"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"I cannot persuade myself that the things which were done or left undone"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"by the leaders of the people are to be attributed to a similar"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"disastrous illusion. Seeing that the direction of our historical destiny"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"after the war was now openly controlled by the Jews, it is impossible to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"admit that a defective knowledge of the state of affairs was the sole"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"cause of our misfortunes. On the contrary, the conclusion that must be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"drawn from the facts is that our people were intentionally driven to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"ruin. If we examine it from this point of view we shall find that the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"direction of the nation's foreign policy was not so foolish as it"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"appeared; for on scrutinizing the matter closely we see clearly that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"this conduct was a procedure which had been calmly calculated, shrewdly"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"defined and logically carried out in the service of the Jewish idea and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the Jewish endeavour to secure the mastery of the world."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"From 1806 to 1813 Prussia was in a state of collapse. But that period"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"sufficed to renew the vital energies of the nation and inspire it once"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"more with a resolute determination to fight. An equal period of time has"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"passed over our heads from 1918 until to-day, and no advantage has been"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"derived from it. On the contrary, the vital strength of our State has"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"been steadily sapped."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Seven years after November 1918 the Locarno Treaty was signed."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Thus the development which took place was what I have indicated above."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Once the shameful Armistice had been signed our people were unable to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"pluck up sufficient courage and energy to call a halt suddenly to the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"conduct of our adversary as the oppressive measures were being"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"constantly renewed. The enemy was too shrewd to put forward all his"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"demands at once. He confined his duress always to those exactions which,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"in his opinion and that of our German Government, could be submitted to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"for the moment: so that in this way they did not risk causing an"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"explosion of public feeling. But according as the single impositions"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"were increasingly subscribed to and tolerated it appeared less"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"justifiable to do now in the case of one sole imposition or act of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"duress what had not been previously done in the case of so many others,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"namely, to oppose it. That is the 'drop of poison' of which Clausewitz"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"speaks. Once this lack of character is manifested the resultant"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"condition becomes steadily aggravated and weighs like an evil"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"inheritance on all future decisions. It may become as a leaden weight"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"around the nation's neck, which cannot be shaken off but which forces it"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"to drag out its existence in slavery."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Thus, in Germany, edicts for disarmament and oppression and economic"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"plunder followed one after the other, making us politically helpless."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The result of all this was to create that mood which made so many look"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"upon the Dawes Plan as a blessing and the Locarno Treaty as a success."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"From a higher point of view we may speak of one sole blessing in the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"midst of so much misery. This blessing is that, though men may be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"fooled, Heaven can't be bribed. For Heaven withheld its blessing. Since"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that time Misery and Anxiety have been the constant companions of our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"people, and Distress is the one Ally that has remained loyal to us. In"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"this case also Destiny has made no exceptions. It has given us our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"deserts. Since we did not know how to value honour any more, it has"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"taught us to value the liberty to seek for bread. Now that the nation"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"has learned to cry for bread, it may one day learn to pray for freedom."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The collapse of our nation in the years following 1918 was bitter and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"manifest. And yet that was the time chosen to persecute us in the most"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"malicious way our enemies could devise, so that what happened afterwards"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"could have been foretold by anybody then. The government to which our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"people submitted was as hopelessly incompetent as it was conceited, and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"this was especially shown in repudiating those who gave any warning that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"disturbed or displeased. Then we saw--and to-day also--the greatest"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"parliamentary nincompoops, really common saddlers and glove-makers--not"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"merely by trade, for that would signify very little--suddenly raised to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the rank of statesmen and sermonizing to humble mortals from that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"pedestal. It did not matter, and it still does not matter, that such a"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"'statesman', after having displayed his talents for six months or so as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"a mere windbag, is shown up for what he is and becomes the object of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"public raillery and sarcasm. It does not matter that he has given the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"most evident proof of complete incompetency. No. That does not matter at"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"all. On the contrary, the less real service the parliamentary statesmen"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of this Republic render the country, the more savagely they persecute"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"all who expect that parliamentary deputies should show some positive"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"results of their activities. And they persecute everybody who dares to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"point to the failure of these activities and predict similar failures"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"for the future. If one finally succeeds in nailing down one of these"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"parliamentarians to hard facts, so that this political artist can no"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"longer deny the real failure of his whole action and its results, then"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"he will find thousands of grounds for excuse, but will in no way admit"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that he himself is the chief cause of the evil."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"In the winter of 1922-23, at the latest, it ought to have been generally"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"recognized that, even after the conclusion of peace, France was still"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"endeavouring with iron consistency to attain those ends which had been"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"originally envisaged as the final purpose of the War. For nobody could"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"think of believing that for four and a half years France continued to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"pour out the not abundant supply of her national blood in the most"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"decisive struggle throughout all her history in order subsequently to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"obtain compensation through reparations for the damages sustained. Even"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Alsace and Lorraine, taken by themselves, would not account for the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"energy with which the French conducted the War, if Alsace-Lorraine were"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"not already considered as a part of the really vast programme which"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"French foreign policy had envisaged for the future. The aim of that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"programme was: Disintegration of Germany into a collection of small"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"states. It was for this that Chauvinist France waged war; and in doing"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"so she was in reality selling her people to be the serfs of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"international Jew."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"French war aims would have been obtained through the World War if, as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"was originally hoped in Paris, the struggle had been carried out on"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"German soil. Let us imagine the bloody battles of the World War not as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"having taken place on the Somme, in Flanders, in Artois, in front of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Warsaw, Nizhni-Novogorod, Kowno, and Riga but in Germany, in the Ruhr or"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"on the Maine, on the Elbe, in front of Hanover, Leipzig, Nürnberg, etc."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"If such happened, then we must admit that the destruction of Germany"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"might have been accomplished. It is very much open to question if our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"young federal State could have borne the hard struggle for four and a"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"half years, as it was borne by a France that had been centralized for"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"centuries, with the whole national imagination focused on Paris. If this"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"titanic conflict between the nations developed outside the frontiers of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"our fatherland, not only is all the merit due to the immortal service"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"rendered by our old army but it was also very fortunate for the future"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of Germany. I am fully convinced that if things had taken a different"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"course there would no longer be a German REICH to-day but only 'German"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"States'. And that is the only reason why the blood which was shed by our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"friends and brothers in the War was at least not shed in vain."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The course which events took was otherwise. In November 1918 Germany did"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"indeed collapse with lightning suddenness. But when the catastrophe took"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"place at home the armies under the Commander-in-Chief were still deep in"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the enemy's country. At that time France's first preoccupation was not"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the dismemberment of Germany but the problem of how to get the German"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"armies out of France and Belgium as quickly as possible. And so, in"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"order to put an end to the War, the first thing that had to be done by"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the Paris Government was to disarm the German armies and push them back"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"into Germany if possible. Until this was done the French could not"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"devote their attention to carrying out their own particular and original"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"war aims. As far as concerned England, the War was really won when"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Germany was destroyed as a colonial and commercial Power and was reduced"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"to the rank of a second-class State. It was not in England's interest to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"wipe out the German State altogether. In fact, on many grounds it was"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"desirable for her to have a future rival against France in Europe."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Therefore French policy was forced to carry on by peaceful means the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"work for which the War had opened the way; and Clemenceau's statement,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that for him Peace was merely a continuation of the War, thus acquired"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"an enhanced significance."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Persistently and on every opportunity that arose, the effort to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"dislocate the framework of the REICH was to have been carried on. By"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"perpetually sending new notes that demanded disarmament, on the one"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"hand, and by the imposition of economic levies which, on the other hand,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"could be carried out as the process of disarmament progressed, it was"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"hoped in Paris that the framework of the REICH would gradually fall to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"pieces. The more the Germans lost their sense of national honour the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"more could economic pressure and continued economic distress be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"effective as factors of political destruction. Such a policy of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"political oppression and economic exploitation, carried out for ten or"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"twenty years, must in the long run steadily ruin the most compact"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"national body and, under certain circumstances, dismember it. Then the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"French war aims would have been definitely attained."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"By the winter of 1922-23 the intentions of the French must already have"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"been known for a long time back. There remained only two possible ways"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of confronting the situation. If the German national body showed itself"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"sufficiently tough-skinned, it might gradually blunt the will of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"French or it might do--once and for all--what was bound to become"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"inevitable one day: that is to say, under the provocation of some"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"particularly brutal act of oppression it could put the helm of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"German ship of state to roundabout and ram the enemy. That would"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"naturally involve a life-and-death-struggle. And the prospect of coming"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"through the struggle alive depended on whether France could be so far"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"isolated that in this second battle Germany would not have to fight"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"against the whole world but in defence of Germany against a France that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"was persistently disturbing the peace of the world."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"I insist on this point, and I am profoundly convinced of it, namely,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that this second alternative will one day be chosen and will have to be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"chosen and carried out in one way or another. I shall never believe that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"France will of herself alter her intentions towards us, because, in the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"last analysis, they are only the expression of the French instinct for"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"self-preservation. Were I a Frenchman and were the greatness of France"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"so dear to me as that of Germany actually is, in the final reckoning I"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"could not and would not act otherwise than a Clemenceau. The French"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"nation, which is slowly dying out, not so much through depopulation as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"through the progressive disappearance of the best elements of the race,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"can continue to play an important role in the world only if Germany be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"destroyed. French policy may make a thousand detours on the march"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"towards its fixed goal, but the destruction of Germany is the end which"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"it always has in view as the fulfilment of the most profound yearning"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"and ultimate intentions of the French. Now it is a mistake to believe"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that if the will on one side should remain only PASSIVE and intent on"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"its own self-preservation it can hold out permanently against another"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"will which is not less forceful but is ACTIVE. As long as the eternal"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"conflict between France and Germany is waged only in the form of a"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"German defence against the French attack, that conflict can never be"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"decided; and from century to century Germany will lose one position"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"after another. If we study the changes that have taken place, from the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"twelfth century up to our day, in the frontiers within which the German"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"language is spoken, we can hardly hope for a successful issue to result"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"from the acceptance and development of a line of conduct which has"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"hitherto been so detrimental for us."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Only when the Germans have taken all this fully into account will they"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"cease from allowing the national will-to-life to wear itself out in"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"merely passive defence, but they will rally together for a last decisive"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"contest with France. And in this contest the essential objective of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"German nation will be fought for. Only then will it be possible to put"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"an end to the eternal Franco-German conflict which has hitherto proved"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"so sterile. Of course it is here presumed that Germany sees in the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"suppression of France nothing more than a means which will make it"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"possible for our people finally to expand in another quarter. To-day"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"there are eighty million Germans in Europe. And our foreign policy will"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"be recognized as rightly conducted only when, after barely a hundred"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"years, there will be 250 million Germans living on this Continent, not"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"packed together as the coolies in the factories of another Continent but"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"as tillers of the soil and workers whose labour will be a mutual"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"assurance for their existence."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"In December 1922 the situation between Germany and France assumed a"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"particularly threatening aspect. France had new and vast oppressive"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"measures in view and needed sanctions for her conduct. Political"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"pressure had to precede the economic plunder, and the French believed"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that only by making a violent attack against the central nervous system"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"profession, still less a politician by birth. But he belonged to that"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"type of politician who is merely used for liGYMNASIUMating some definite"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"question. Apart from that, he had business experience. It was a curse"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"for Germany that, in the practice of politics, this business man looked"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"upon politics also as a business undertaking and regulated his conduct"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"accordingly."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"France occupies the Ruhr. What is there in the Ruhr? Coal. And so
France occupies the Ruhr for the sake of its coal? What could come more"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"naturally to the mind of Herr Cuno than the idea of a strike, which"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"would prevent the French from obtaining any coal? And therefore, in the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"opinion of Herr Cuno, one day or other they would certainly have to get"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"out of the Ruhr again if the occupation did not prove to be a paying"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"business. Such were approximately the lines along which that OUTSTANDING"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"NATIONAL STATESMAN reasoned. At Stuttgart and other places he spoke to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"'his people' and this people became lost in admiration for him. Of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"course they needed the Marxists for the strike, because the workers"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"would have to be the first to go on strike. Now, in the brain of a"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"bourgeois statesman such as Cuno, a Marxist and a worker are one and the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"same thing. Therefore it was necessary to bring the worker into line"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"with all the other Germans in a united front. One should have seen how"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the countenances of these party politicians beamed with the light of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"their moth-eaten bourgeois culture when the great genius spoke the word"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of revelation to them. Here was a nationalist and also a man of genius."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"At last they had discovered what they had so long sought. For now the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"abyss between Marxism and themselves could be bridged over. And thus it"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"became possible for the pseudo-nationalist to ape the German manner and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"adopt nationalist phraseology in reaching out the ingenuous hand of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"friendship to the internationalist traitors of their country. The"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"traitor readily grasped that hand, because, just as Herr Cuno had need"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of the Marxist chiefs for his 'united front', the Marxist chiefs needed"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Herr Cuno's money. So that both parties mutually benefited by the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"transaction. Cuno obtained his united front, constituted of nationalist"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"charlatans and international swindlers. And now, with the help of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"money paid to them by the State, these people were able to pursue their"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"glorious mission, which was to destroy the national economic system. It"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"was an immortal thought, that of saving a nation by means of a general"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"strike in which the strikers were paid by the State. It was a command"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that could be enthusiastically obeyed by the most indifferent of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"loafers."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Everybody knows that prayers will not make a nation free. But that it is"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"historical experience. Instead of promoting a paid general strike at"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that time, and making this the basis of his 'united front', if Herr Cuno"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"had demanded two hours more work from every German, then the swindle of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"Nations do not obtain their freedom by refusing to work but by making"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"sacrifices."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Anyhow, the so-called passive resistance could not last long. Nobody but"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"a man entirely ignorant of war could imagine that an army of occupation"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"might be frightened and driven out by such ridiculous means. And yet"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"this could have been the only purpose of an action for which the country"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"had to pay out milliards and which contributed seriously to devaluate"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the national currency."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Of course the French were able to make themselves almost at home in the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Ruhr basin the moment they saw that such ridiculous measures were being"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"adopted against them. They had received the prescription directly from"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"sense of reason if its conduct implied a serious danger for the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"seriousness of the situation, when the activities of these bands"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"threatened grave danger for the German army. In like manner if the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"passive resistance of the Ruhr became really dangerous for the French,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the armies of occupation would have needed no more than eight days to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"bring the whole piece of childish nonsense to a gruesome end. For we"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"must always go back to the original question in all this business: What"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"were we to do if the passive resistance came to the point where it"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"really got on the nerves of our opponents and they proceeded to suppress"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"it with force and bloodshed? Would we still continue to resist? If so,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"then, for weal or woe, we would have to submit to a severe and bloody"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"persecution. And in that case we should be faced with the same situation"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"as would have faced us in the case of an active resistance. In other"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"words, we should have to fight. Therefore the so-called passive"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"resistance would be logical only if supported by the determination to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"come out and wage an open fight in case of necessity or adopt a kind of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"guerilla warfare. Generally speaking, one undertakes such a struggle"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"when there is a possibility of success. The moment a besieged fortress"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"is taken by assault there is no practical alternative left to the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"defenders except to surrender, if instead of probable death they are"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"assured that their lives will be spared. Let the garrison of a citadel"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"which has been completely encircled by the enemy once lose all hope of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"being delivered by their friends, then the strength of the defence"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"collapses totally."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"That is why passive resistance in the Ruhr, when one considers the final"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"consequences which it might and must necessarily have if it were to turn"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"out really successful, had no practical meaning unless an active front"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"had been organized to support it. Then one might have demanded immense"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"efforts from our people. If each of these Westphalians in the Ruhr could"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"have been assured that the home country had mobilized an army of eighty"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"or a hundred divisions to support them, the French would have found"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"themselves treading on thorns. Surely a greater number of courageous men"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"could be found to sacrifice themselves for a successful enterprise than"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"for an enterprise that was manifestly futile."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"This was the classic occasion that induced us National Socialists to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"take up a resolute stand against the so-called national word of command."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"And that is what we did. During those months I was attacked by people"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"whose patriotism was a mixture of stupidity and humbug and who took part"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"in the general hue and cry because of the pleasant sensation they felt"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"at being suddenly enabled to show themselves as nationalists, without"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"running any danger thereby. In my estimation, this despicable 'united"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"front' was one of the most ridiculous things that could be imagined. And"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"events proved that I was right."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"As soon as the Trades Unions had nearly filled their treasuries with"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Cuno's contributions, and the moment had come when it would be necessary"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"to transform the passive resistance from a mere inert defence into"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"active aggression, the Red hyenas suddenly broke out of the national"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"sheepfold and returned to be what they always had been. Without sounding"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"any drums or trumpets, Herr Cuno returned to his ships. Germany was"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"richer by one experience and poorer by the loss of one great hope."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Up to midsummer of that year several officers, who certainly were not"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the least brave and honourable of their kind, had not really believed"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"that the course of things could take a turn that was so humiliating."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"They had all hoped that--if not openly, then at least secretly--the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"necessary measures would be taken to make this insolent French invasion"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"a turning-point in German history. In our ranks also there were many who"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"counted at least on the intervention of the REICHSWEHR. That conviction"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"was so ardent that it decisively influenced the conduct and especially"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the training of innumerable young men."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"But when the disgraceful collapse set in and the most humiliating kind"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"of capitulation was made, indignation against such a betrayal of our"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"unhappy country broke out into a blaze. Millions of German money had"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"been spent in vain and thousands of young Germans had been sacrificed,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"who were foolish enough to trust in the promises made by the rulers of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the REICH. Millions of people now became clearly convinced that Germany"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"could be saved only if the whole prevailing system were destroyed root"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"and branch."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"There never had been a more propitious moment for such a solution. On"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the one side an act of high treason had been committed against the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"country, openly and shamelessly. On the other side a nation found itself"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"delivered over to die slowly of hunger. Since the State itself had"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"trodden down all the precepts of faith and loyalty, made a mockery of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"the rights of its citizens, rendered the sacrifices of millions of its"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"most loyal sons fruitless and robbed other millions of their last penny,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"such a State could no longer expect anything but hatred from its"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"subjects. This hatred against those who had ruined the people and the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"country was bound to find an outlet in one form or another. In this"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"connection I shall quote here the concluding sentence of a speech which"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"I delivered at the great court trial that took place in the spring of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"1924."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"The judges of this State may tranquilly condemn us for our conduct at
that time, but History, the goddess of a higher truth and a better legal
code, will smile as she tears up this verdict and will acquit us all of
the crime for which this verdict demands punishment."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"But History will then also summon before its own tribunal those who,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"invested with power to-day, have trampled on law and justice, condemning"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"our people to misery and ruin, and who, in the hour of their country's"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"misfortune, took more account of their own ego than of the life of the"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"community."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"Here I shall not relate the course of events which led to November 8th,"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"that this would serve any beneficial purpose in the future and also"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"because no good could come of opening old sores that have been just only"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"closed. Moreover, it would be out of place to talk about the guilt of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"men who perhaps in the depths of their hearts have as much love for"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"their people as I myself, and who merely did not follow the same road as"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"I took or failed to recognize it as the right one to take."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"In the face of the great misfortune which has befallen our fatherland"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"those men who must at some future date form one great united front which"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"will be made up of true and loyal Germans and which will have to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"withstand the common front presented by the enemy of our people. For I"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"know that a time will come when those who then treated us as enemies"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"will venerate the men who trod the bitter way of death for the sake of"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"their people."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"I have dedicated the first volume of this book to our eighteen fallen"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"

"all, I should like to mention the name of a man who devoted his life to"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"reawakening his and our people, through his writing and his ideas and"	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
"finally through positive action. I mean: Dietrich Eckart."	"CHAPTER XXVII   THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE"
