<p>This Tableau visualization using the database compiled by the Washington Post. More on the WaPo data here:</p>

<p>I don’t have any particular interest in police fatalities, nor have I ever really studied the matter. I originally wanted to just find data that felt alive and held significance. When I came across the WaPo fatal force data, I definitely felt that there was important significance to the dataset.</p>
<p>In 2019, over a thousand American citizens fell to brutal force by the police. I hope to bring attention to this issue by visualizing it beyond what WaPo’s visualizations currently do.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to have a full on report at some point, but alas that time hasn’t come just yet. The following Tableau viz however is something that I’m continually updating to find intricacies in the data.</p>
