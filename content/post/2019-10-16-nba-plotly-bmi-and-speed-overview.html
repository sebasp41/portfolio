<p>Basketball, size and defense. This season especially, I felt it important to analyze what teams looked like, and how that look - as defined by BMI - translated alongside an advanced defensive metric in <a href="https://www.bball-index.com/current-pipm/">DPIPM</a>(from bball-index).</p>
<p>Working on a writeup for my analysis soon. But for now, I’ve included a Tableau visualization for players’ respective BMI vs. DPIPM grouped by a k-means cluster. Tableau k-means methods can be <a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/clustering.htm">found here</a>.</p>
<p>In short, what would the colors mean… or what could each colo represent about a player’s size and performance on defense?</p>
<p>From the point of view of a player dribbling the ball:</p>
<p>Brown means: <span style="color:brown">dude’s huge, I should stay away</span>.</p>
<p>Pink means: <span style="color:pink">dude moves like molasses, because his diet is mostly comprised of molasses</span>.</p>
<p>Orange means: <span style="color:orange">soft</span>.</p>
<p>Blue means: <span style="color:blue">middle of the road</span>.</p>
<p>Purple means: <span style="color:purple">chunky, but no pushover</span>.</p>
<p>Red means: <span style="color:red">IDK, mostly meh and bad but some sleepers (like Barton)</span>.</p>
<p>violets are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.</p>
