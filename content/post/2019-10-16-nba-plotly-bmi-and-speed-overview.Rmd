Basketball, size and defense. This season especially, I felt it important to analyze what teams looked like, and how that look - as defined by BMI - translated alongside an advanced defensive metric in [DPIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/current-pipm/)(from bball-index).

Working on a writeup for my analysis soon. But for now, I've included a Tableau visualization for players' respective BMI vs. DPIPM grouped by a k-means cluster. Tableau k-means methods can be [found here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/clustering.htm). 

In short, what would the colors mean... or what could each colo represent about a player's size and performance on defense?

From the point of view of a player dribbling the ball: 

Brown means: <span style="color:brown">dude's huge, I should stay away</span>. 

Pink means: <span style="color:pink">dude moves like molasses, because his diet is mostly comprised of molasses</span>.

Orange means: <span style="color:orange">soft</span>.

Blue means: <span style="color:blue">middle of the road</span>.

Purple means: <span style="color:purple">chunky, but no pushover</span>.

Green means: <span style="color:green">don't go ahead against this guy</span>.

Red means: <span style="color:red">IDK, mostly meh and bad but some sleepers (like Barton)</span>.
