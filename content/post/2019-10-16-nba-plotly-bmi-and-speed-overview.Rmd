Basketball, size and defense. This season especially, I felt it important to analyze what teams looked like, and how that look - as defined by BMI - translated alongside an advanced defensive metric in [DPIPM](https://www.bball-index.com/current-pipm/)(from bball-index).

Working on a writeup for my analysis soon. But for now, I've included a Tableau visualization for players' respective BMI vs. DPIPM grouped by a k-means cluster. Tableau k-means methods can be [found here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/clustering.htm).
