**Education**

University of Washington, 2009-2013   
Bachelor's of Arts  
Political Science, Mathematics Minor  

When I'm not working or watching basketball, I'm probably drinking a ton of coffee or watching a good ol' British murder mystery with my wife. I also own a dog named Penny, a yellow lab. We hike, play and eat with her.

I've recently completed a Statistics course in order to get into a respective Master's program.

**Tableau Public**
I've recently started to upkeep a [visualization dashboard linked here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sebastian.pycior#!/vizhome/shooting_map/Dashboard1?publish=yes) which simply exhibites Washington Post's database on police shootings in the United States.


**Nylon**

Check out some of my basketball analysis [here at Nylon Calculus](https://fansided.com/author/spycior/). Most of my work there involves looking at NBA trends and using basic regression analysis to make arguments about players, teams, and even coaches. I use basketball in order to help me learn about stats and R programming.
