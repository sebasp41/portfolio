      <description>What makes a car dangerous to drive for a consumer? There are plenty of variables to consider and for this entry in particular I wanted to see if car dimensions were significantly related to death rates in vehicles.
Using R I’m going to review the data at hand, visualize it and then work through a multiple regression analysis.
Car Deaths and Car Dimension Data I retrieved car death rate data from the IIHS available by make and model here for the years 2001-2017 (years ’99-’01 are TBD).</description>
