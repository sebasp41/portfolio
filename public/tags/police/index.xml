      <description>This Tableau visualization using the database compiled by the Washington Post. More on the WaPo data here:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/
Initially, I didnâ€™t have any particular interest in police fatalities, nor have I ever really studied the matter. I originally wanted to just find data that felt alive and held significance. When I came across the WaPo fatal force data, I definitely felt that there was important significance to the dataset.</description>
