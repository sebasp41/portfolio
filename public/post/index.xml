      <description>Below is an updating categorical analysis report on American college basketball recruits heading to the 2019 NBA Draft. The report matches 2018-2019 NCAAMB statistics from sports-reference to Aran Smith’s 2019 Big Board: Top 100 Prospects. The report methodology is based on Ed Weiland’s analysis, which I took and retooled just a bit. Here, I first wrote using the analysis at Nylon Calculus for the 2018 NBA Draft class.</description>

      <description>Yup. Here’s the hot take: VORP should be used to pay players in college basketball. The following table shows salaries of every Men’s College Basketball Athlete’s potential salary based on hypothetical contingencies based on the VORP metric and a NBA based unionization agreement between college athletes and the NCAA.
Legend Player - Player.
School - Player’s university
G - Games
BPM - BPM, a variable used as a part of the rawVORP calculation.</description>
